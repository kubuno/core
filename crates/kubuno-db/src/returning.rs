//! Getting a row back from a write, on an engine that may not have `RETURNING`.
//!
//! PostgreSQL and SQLite (3.35+) both support `RETURNING`. MySQL and MariaDB do
//! not — MariaDB has `INSERT ... RETURNING`, but not on `UPDATE`/`DELETE` and
//! not with `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`, so the whole family is treated here as
//! lacking it.
//!
//! # The prerequisite nobody can skip
//!
//! 295 Kubuno tables declare `id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`.
//! Neither MySQL nor SQLite has such a default, and the only way the process
//! learns a DB-generated key is `RETURNING`, which MySQL lacks. So the id must
//! be generated in Rust ([`crate::new_id`]) and bound like any other column.
//!
//! # How the helpers work
//!
//! * PostgreSQL / SQLite: one statement, with `RETURNING` appended.
//! * MySQL: two statements — the write, and a re-`SELECT` by primary key. Both
//!   run on the [`DbTx`] you pass, so a concurrent session cannot slip between
//!   them.
