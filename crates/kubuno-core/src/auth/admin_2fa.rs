//! Instance requirement: administrators must carry a second factor.
//!
//! ## The ordering that makes this safe
//!
//! This module is deliberately the *last* of the three pieces. Making the second
//! factor mandatory on an instance that has no backup codes and no local recovery
//! path is a way to lock an operator out of their own server for good. Both exist
//! before this switch does: [`crate::auth::backup_codes`] and the
//! `kubuno auth:recover` subcommand.
//!
//! ## The grace window is stamped per account, not computed from the switch
//!
//! `core.users.admin_2fa_grace_until` is written the first time an administrator
//! without a second factor is seen while the requirement is on. Deriving the
//! deadline from "when the setting was flipped" instead would hand an account
//! created a month later a window that had already elapsed — a new administrator
//! refused on their first sign-in, with nothing they did wrong to point at.
//!
//! Enrolling clears the stamp (see the `/me/2fa/enable` handler), so an operator
//! who later turns their second factor off gets a fresh delay rather than an
//! immediate refusal.
