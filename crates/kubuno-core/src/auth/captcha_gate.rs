//! The per-identifier failure counter that arms the sign-in CAPTCHA.
//!
//! # Why this is separate from [`crate::auth::login_throttle`]
//!
//! The throttle (account lockout) is keyed by user id — it must be, since it
//! protects a specific account and resets on that account's success. Keying the
//! CAPTCHA gate the same way turned it into an enumeration oracle: an unknown
//! login never accrued failures there (no row is created for a stranger, on
//! purpose), so a CAPTCHA appeared only for accounts that exist. This module
//! keys the count on the SUBMITTED IDENTIFIER instead (hashed), so the gate arms
//! identically whether or not the identifier names a real account — the CAPTCHA
//! is demanded the same either way, and existence stays hidden.
//!
//! The raw identifier is never stored: only its SHA-256. Rows are swept once
//! stale, so counting failures for made-up identifiers cannot grow the table
//! without bound (the per-IP sign-in rate limit bounds the inflow too).
