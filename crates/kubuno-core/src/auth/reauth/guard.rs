//! The extractor a sensitive handler takes instead of [`AuthUser`].
//!
//! It authenticates exactly like `AuthUser` and then adds one condition: the
//! caller must have proved presence recently — either by presenting a re-auth
//! token in `X-Reauth-Token`, or by being inside the grace window opened by an
//! earlier proof.
//!
//! Refusals are **distinguishable**, which is the whole reason the mechanism
//! exists. A plain `Forbidden` tells a client nothing it can act on; here the
//! client receives `REAUTH_REQUIRED` and knows to open the dialog and replay.
