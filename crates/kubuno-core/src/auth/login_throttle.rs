//! Per-account sign-in throttle: exponential backoff against credential
//! stuffing and brute force, persisted in `core.login_throttle`.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! [`crate::auth::rate_limit`] limits attempts per IP, in process memory. That
//! is useful against a burst from one address but useless against the shape of a
//! real attack: credential stuffing is *distributed* (a few tries from each of
//! thousands of addresses), and the in-memory counter is reset on restart and
//! not shared between instances. What was missing is a ceiling **per account**,
//! persistent and shared — the only thing that resists a targeted guess. This
//! module is that ceiling.
//!
//! # Behaviour
//!
//! Modelled on OWASP (Credential Stuffing / Authentication cheat sheets), NIST
//! SP 800-63B §5.2.2 and the ANSSI/CNIL password recommendations:
//!
//! * a temporising **exponential backoff**, never a hard permanent lock — a
//!   permanent lock would hand an attacker a denial of service on any account
//!   whose e-mail they know;
//! * the delay starts after [`SOFT_THRESHOLD`] failures and doubles each further
//!   failure (`> 1 min` after 5 failures, per ANSSI), capped at [`MAX_DELAY`];
//! * a daily cap of [`WINDOW_CAP`] attempts over a 24 h window (ANSSI) and an
//!   absolute ceiling of [`HARD_CAP`] consecutive failures (NIST);
//! * **reset on success** (NIST SHOULD): the row is deleted;
//! * a password reset re-opens the account regardless (the reset flow does not
//!   go through here), so temporising is never a dead end.
//!
//! The caller never tells the client that an account is locked (that would be an
//! enumeration oracle): [`is_locked`] returning `true` maps to the same generic
//! "invalid credentials" answer, and the sign-in handler runs the argon2 verify
//! either way so the response timing does not change.
