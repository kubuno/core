//! Scoping personal API tokens: what a bearer may do, and for how long.
//!
//! ## The defect this closes
//!
//! [`AuthUser`](crate::auth::middleware::AuthUser) accepts a signed session *or*
//! a personal API token and yields the same `User` either way. Before this
//! module, `core.api_tokens` carried no notion of scope, `expires_at` was
//! nullable, and resolution never looked at the owner's second factor. A token
//! minted by an administrator was therefore a complete, permanent administration
//! key that bypassed step-up authentication — the last of the five findings of
//! the security audit, and the only one still open.
//!
//! ## The shape of the fix
//!
//! ```text
//!   raw token ──► grant::resolve ──► TokenGrant { scopes, is_legacy, grace }
//!                       │                          │
//!                       │                          ├─ AuthSource (request ext)
//!                       │                          │
//!                       └─ refuses: unknown, revoked, expired,
//!                          owner disabled, grace window closed
//!
//!   AdminContext(owner's privileges, resolved fresh)
//!                       │
//!                       └─ narrow::apply(ctx, grant) ──► effective privilege
//!                                                        = INTERSECTION
//! ```
//!
//! Four properties hold, and each one is a test:
//!
//! 1. **A token never grants more than its owner.** The effective privilege is
//!    the intersection of the token's scopes with what the owner holds.
//! 2. **Re-evaluated at every use.** The owner's context is resolved per request
//!    (through a five-second cache); the intersection is applied *after* that
//!    read, never stored. Withdraw a privilege from the owner and the token loses
//!    it on the next call.
//! 3. **Scopes are explicit and mandatory.** An empty list is refused by the
//!    database `CHECK` as well as by [`policy::validate_requested`], and the
//!    creator may only pick scopes they themselves hold at that instant.
//! 4. **Some scopes are never grantable.** Granting power, installing modules,
//!    approving themes and resetting a second factor require a person; see
//!    [`policy`].
//!
//! ## Origin, not a second notion of it
//!
//! Step-up re-authentication ([`crate::auth::reauth`]) already needed to tell a
//! human from a program and reads
//! [`ActorOrigin`](crate::audit::ActorOrigin) out of
//! [`AuthSource`](crate::auth::middleware::AuthSource). This module extends that
//! same record with the grant instead of introducing a parallel one: there is
//! exactly one answer in the request to "how did this caller authenticate".
