//! The catalogue of alert types, and the recommended actions each one ships
//! with.
//!
//! ## The rule this file exists to enforce
//!
//! **An alert type without an action is not created.** The instance already has
//! an audit trail and an event log; a queue that only restates them, with a
//! badge on top, teaches its operator to ignore the badge. So every `kind`
//! below answers "what do I do about it?" with at least one addressable
//! surface, and adding a `kind` means adding its actions in the same commit.
//!
//! ## Why the catalogue is Rust and not a table
//!
//! Same reasoning as [`crate::health::checks`]: the wording, the severity and
//! above all the *destination* of an action change with the code. A row in the
//! database would be a copy of the code that drifts from it, and the copy that
//! drifts is always the one telling the operator to open a screen that no
//! longer exists.
//!
//! ## Actions are computed, never stored
//!
//! [`actions_for`] rebuilds them on every read from the alert's `kind` and
//! `payload`. An action serialised into the row at production time would still
//! point at last month's menu after a refactor.
