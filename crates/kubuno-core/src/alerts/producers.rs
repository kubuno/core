//! The producers: the only things that write alerts.
//!
//! ## What is in here, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! Every producer below observes something the core **already records today**.
//! Nothing is invented, nothing depends on a collector that does not exist: a
//! producer that cannot be triggered is a feature that cannot be trusted.
//!
//! Two shapes, and the difference governs auto-closure:
//!
//! * **State producers** describe a condition that is either true or false right
//!   now — a module that is not answering, a volume with 4 % left, a health
//!   check that is failing, a job type that has given up. They publish the
//!   exhaustive set of live problems, and [`store::auto_resolve`] closes the
//!   alerts that are no longer in it. Without that, the queue accumulates
//!   findings that were fixed weeks ago and stops being read.
//!
//! * **Event producers** describe something that *happened* — a privilege was
//!   granted, a sensitive setting was changed. These never auto-close: the event
//!   does not stop having happened, and only a human can say "yes, that was me".
//!
//! ## Never a credential
//!
//! A producer reads verdicts and counts. `security.sensitive_setting` records
//! *which* key changed and *who* changed it, never the value — the audit trail
//! already redacts snapshots, and copying a redacted value here would be one
//! more place to get it wrong.
