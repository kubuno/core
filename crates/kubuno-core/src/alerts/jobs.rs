//! The recurring scan, expressed as a job type of the existing runner.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no loop of its own** in this feature. The core
//! already has one scheduler (`crate::jobs`), with claiming, backoff, crash
//! recovery and an admin-tunable concurrency; a second timer spawned next to it
//! would be a second thing to supervise, invisible to the panel that supervises
//! the first.
//!
//! The handler re-arms itself on success, exactly like the event-log and audit
//! purges do: a failing pass is retried by the runner instead of silently
//! skipping a cycle, and [`schedule`] revives the chain at startup if it ever
//! gave up for good.
