//! Portable equivalents of the PostgreSQL SQL functions the handlers rely on.
//!
//! The core schema historically shipped a handful of `LANGUAGE sql` / plpgsql
//! functions — `core.org_unit_descendants`, `core.org_unit_ancestors`,
//! `core.superadmin_ids`, `core.label_access`, `core.setting_chain`,
//! `core.setting_overrides` — that the request handlers call inline
//! (`FROM core.org_unit_descendants($1) d`, `WHERE ... IN (SELECT ...
//! FROM core.superadmin_ids())`). MySQL and SQLite have no such stored
//! functions, so those calls fail at run time on any non-PostgreSQL deployment.
//!
//! This module produces the same result sets as **SQL fragments** built for the
//! configured [`Backend`]: a recursive CTE for the tree walks (supported by
//! PostgreSQL, MySQL 8+ and SQLite alike) and a plain derived table for the
//! non-recursive ones. Callers interpolate the fragment where they used to name
//! the function, keep the same table alias, and bind the same values.
//!
//! # Placeholders
//!
//! [`kubuno_db::sql::prepare`] rejects reused or out-of-order `$n`, because
//! MySQL/SQLite placeholders are positional. Each helper therefore takes the
//! number of the *next* free placeholder and consumes a known, documented count
//! of them; the caller binds one value per placeholder, in order. A tree walk's
//! root id is bound once (or once per root, for the multi-root variant).
//!
//! # Depth guard
//!
//! Every recursive walk is bounded by [`MAX_TREE_DEPTH`]. A cycle stored by a
//! past bug (A → B → A) must degrade into a truncated result, never hang the
//! backend — MySQL and SQLite do not detect cycles on their own, and neither
//! does PostgreSQL's `WITH RECURSIVE` without such a guard.
