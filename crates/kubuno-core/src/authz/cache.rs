//! Short-lived memory cache of resolved administrative contexts.
//!
//! The resolution query runs once per HTTP request, which is already cheap, but
//! the administration console fires a dozen requests per screen and every one of
//! them would pay a recursive subtree expansion. A few seconds of caching
//! removes that without changing any answer.
//!
//! ## Why the TTL is small, and why invalidation is global
//!
//! A cache on an authorisation decision is a window during which a **revoked**
//! privilege still works. That window is the only thing that matters here, so:
//!
//!  * the TTL is seconds, not minutes;
//!  * every write to a role, a role's privileges, or an assignment calls
//!    [`invalidate_all`] — not "invalidate the subject", because an assignment
//!    made to a *group* changes the context of everyone in that group, and a
//!    privilege removed from a *role* changes it for everyone holding the role.
//!    Working out that closure correctly on every write is exactly the kind of
//!    thing that is right on the day it is written and wrong six months later;
//!    dropping the whole map costs one resolution per active administrator.
//!
//! The cache is process-global on purpose: the core is a single process, and
//! threading a handle through `AppState` would buy nothing but ceremony.

// that administer nothing. Resolving those would add two queries per page load
// (the resolution, then the fallback that reads the caller's own unit) to pay for
// an answer that is always "holds nothing".
//
// The roster is the fast path: one small set, shared by the whole process, of the
// accounts that hold at least one live assignment — directly or through a group.
// An account absent from it resolves to the empty context with **no query at
// all**. It is one query per TTL for the entire instance instead of two per
// ordinary page load, and it cannot answer "no" wrongly: the same
// [`invalidate_all`] that already runs after every write to a role or an
// assignment drops it, so a freshly granted delegate is visible on their next
