//! Delegated administration: privileges, roles, assignments, and the guards
//! that keep delegation from becoming escalation.
//!
//! ## The model in one paragraph
//!
//! A **privilege** (`<space>.<domain>.<verb>`) is a capability. A **role** is a
//! named bag of privileges — nothing more; it knows no subject and no scope. An
//! **assignment** binds a subject (a user *or* a group, never both) to a role
//! over a scope (the whole instance, or one organisational unit and its
//! subtree), optionally until a date. Keeping the role and the assignment
//! separate is what makes delegation expressible at all: the same "user
//! administrator" role is held by one person instance-wide and by another over a
//! single branch.
//!
//! ```text
//!   core.privileges ──< core.role_privileges >── core.roles ──< core.role_assignments
//!        │                                                            │
//!        └ is_ou_scopable ────────── the rule below ───────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! ## The rule that makes the scope real
//!
//! An assignment scoped to an organisational unit is **refused** when its role
//! contains even one privilege that cannot be confined to a subtree
//! ([`guards::ensure_scopable`]). Instance settings, modules, roles, the audit
//! trail and groups (a group crosses units by construction) are not scopable.
//! Without this rule an operator "restricted to Marketing" holding
//! `core.settings.manage` would still reconfigure the entire instance, and the
//! person who granted the role would believe the opposite — which is worse than
//! having no scope at all.
//!
//! ## Where each piece lives
//!
//! * [`model`] — types and the key grammar;
//! * [`catalog`] — what a module may declare, and how orphans are kept;
//! * [`context`] — resolution of the caller's effective privileges, one query;
//! * [`cache`] — the short-lived memory cache and its invalidation;
//! * [`guard`] — the `/admin/*` layer and the `AdminCtx` extractor;
//! * [`guards`] — the five anti-escalation guards.
