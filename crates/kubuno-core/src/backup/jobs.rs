//! The scheduler, expressed as two job types of the runner that already exists.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no loop of its own** here. `crate::jobs` already
//! provides claiming with `SKIP LOCKED`, exponential backoff, crash recovery,
//! wake-up by `NOTIFY` and an admin-tunable concurrency; a timer spawned beside
//! it would be a second thing to supervise, invisible to the panel that
//! supervises the first. The recurring type re-arms itself on success, exactly
//! like `core.cleanup_event_log` and `core.purge_admin_audit`.
//!
//! ## Two types, and why not one
//!
//! * [`RUN`] — the recurring occurrence. It re-arms itself.
//! * [`RUN_NOW`] — a manual run, enqueued by the console.
//!
//! They are separate because `queue::reschedule_after` refuses to insert when a
//! job of the same type is already pending: a manual run sitting in the queue
//! would silently swallow the recurring job's re-arm and stop the schedule dead
//! — a bug whose only symptom is that backups quietly stop, which is the exact
//! failure this feature exists to prevent.
//!
//! ## A failed dump is not a failed job
//!
//! Tonight's failure must not cancel tomorrow's attempt. So the handler records
//! the failure in `core.backup_runs` (where the alert producer and the health
//! check read it), re-arms the next occurrence and returns `Ok`. Returning `Err`
//! would hand the job to the runner's retry-then-give-up path and leave the
//! chain dead until the next restart — trading a visible failure for an
//! invisible one. Only a failure of the *bookkeeping itself* is an `Err`: at
//! that point nothing can be recorded, and the queue's own machinery is the last
//! thing still watching.
