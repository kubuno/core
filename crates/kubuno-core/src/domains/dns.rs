//! The only thing that turns a typed name into a proven one.
//!
//! ## Why the product resolves DNS itself
//!
//! Ownership of a domain cannot be asserted from inside the console: whoever
//! filled the form is exactly the person whose claim is in doubt. The proof has
//! to be something only the domain's controller can produce, and reading it has
//! to happen somewhere they cannot forge — which leaves a DNS query.
//!
//! This is the one outward request this feature makes, it is made against the
//! name an administrator typed, and it is made when they ask for it (or by the
//! background refresh of the mail diagnosis). Nothing here contacts a third
//! party on a user's behalf, and no user data leaves the instance: the query is
//! the domain name, which the administrator just published to the world anyway.
//!
//! ## What it deliberately cannot do
//!
//! It reads. It never writes, never suggests a registrar, never proxies through
//! anybody's API. An instance whose resolver is unreachable degrades to "je n'ai
//! pas pu vérifier, voici pourquoi" — never to "vérifié" and never to a silent
//! failure.
