//! The migration, expressed as one job type of the runner that already exists.
//!
//! ## One type, no payload, no timer of its own
//!
//! There is deliberately no loop here and no job per campaign. `crate::jobs`
//! already provides claiming with `SKIP LOCKED`, backoff, crash recovery and an
//! admin-tunable concurrency; a second scheduler beside it would be a thing to
//! supervise that the panel supervising the first cannot see.
//!
//! And it is one type carrying **no campaign id**, because
//! [`queue::ensure_scheduled`] refuses to insert while a job of the same type
//! is pending: a per-campaign payload would let the second campaign started
//! that minute silently swallow the first one's re-arm. So the type means "walk
//! whatever is running", the tick walks every running campaign, and starting a
//! campaign is `ensure_scheduled` — idempotent by construction.
//!
//! ## A failed mailbox is not a failed job
//!
//! A source that refuses a password fails ONE account, is recorded on that row,
//! and the tick moves to the next mailbox. Returning `Err` there would hand the
//! whole campaign to the runner's retry-then-give-up path and stop two hundred
//! other accounts because one password was wrong.
//!
//! A module that is unreachable is the other case: nothing is wrong with the
//! account, so the row is released untouched and the chain re-arms later. The
//! distinction is what stops a module restart from marking every mailbox red.
//!
//! ## Why the chain stops
//!
//! The tick re-arms itself only while work remains. An instance that has never
//! migrated anything runs no timer at all — the queue is empty and stays empty
//! until an administrator starts a campaign.
