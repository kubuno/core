//! Which accounts used which application, counted where the core already knows.
//!
//! # Why the proxy is the only honest vantage point
//!
//! A module owns its own PostgreSQL schema and the core never reads it, so the
//! core cannot ask a module how much it was used — and a module that has to
//! *declare* its own attendance is a module that can forget to, or never
//! implement it. But every browser call to every module crosses
//! [`crate::modules::proxy`]: the account is resolved there (to forward
//! `X-Kubuno-User-Id`) and the module id is in the path. The two facts meet at
//! exactly one point in the whole system, and this is the counter placed at it.
//! No module cooperates; none can opt out; none can inflate its own figure.
//!
//! # What is counted, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! One number per `(day, module, account)`. **No URL, no path, no method, no IP
//! address, no payload** — see the preamble of migration `000123`, which states
//! the rule the schema enforces. The day is stamped in the instance's time zone
//! at the moment of the hit, so the counter cannot be resolved back into a
//! timetable, only into "this account used drive on Tuesday".
//!
//! # Cost on the request path: one hash-map insert
//!
//! [`UsageMeter::record`] takes a mutex, bumps an integer and returns. It never
//! awaits, never touches the database and never allocates for a key that is
//! already present. The database write is a *batch* upsert performed by
//! [`flusher`] on its own task, so a slow database delays the counter and never
//! the response the person is waiting for.
//!
//! Memory is bounded by [`MAX_PENDING`]: past that, hits for keys not already
//! being tracked are dropped and counted, because a metric must never be the
//! reason an instance runs out of memory. The drop is reported in the log at the
//! next flush rather than silently absorbed.
