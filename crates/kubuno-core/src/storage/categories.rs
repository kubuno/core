//! The vocabulary a module declares its storage under, and the two properties
//! the core derives from it: what is *billed* to the account, and what is
//! *held* by the declaring module.
//!
//! ## Why a closed vocabulary rather than free text
//!
//! The whole point of the breakdown is that the shares add up. A free-text
//! category lets `drive` write `"thumbs"` while `photos` writes `"thumbnails"`,
//! and the console then shows two slices of the same thing that no operator can
//! compare — and, worse, lets a module invent a category the core does not know
//! is billable, so the quota silently changes meaning. The list below is short,
//! technical, and refused at the door when a module strays outside it.
//!
//! ## THE BILLING CRITERION
//!
//! > **An account is billed for what it can free itself.**
//!
//! That is the whole rule, and it is sharper than "user content" because it is
//! decidable: point at the handle. Files, the bin and a revision history the
//! account can purge all have one — deleting, emptying, turning versioning off.
//! Thumbnails, search indexes, transcodes and upload chunks have none: the
//! account never asked for them, cannot enumerate them and cannot remove them,
//! so charging for them would be charging for a decision it did not make and
//! cannot unmake.
//!
//! The criterion has a sharp consequence, and it is deliberate: **the same word
//! can fall on either side depending on what the module lets the account do.**
//! `drive` exposes `DELETE /:id/versions/:vid` and a per-file versioning switch,
//! so its history is [`Category::Versions`] and billed. `office` keeps up to
//! `office.max_versions` revisions with no way to remove one, so its history is
//! [`Category::Retention`] and not billed. A module that wants its retention
//! billed does not relabel it — it gives the account a delete button.
//!
//! ## The two properties, and why they are separate
//!
//! * [`Category::is_billable`] — does this count against the account's quota?
//!   Answered by the criterion above.
//! * [`Category::is_held`] — does this count toward the physical volume
//!   attributed to the declaring module? Everything the module actually stores
//!   does, billable or not. Exactly one category is *not* held
//!   ([`Category::Delegated`]) — see its own note.
//!
//! Billed is therefore always a subset of held, and the console shows both: the
//! operator sizes a disk on `held`, the account is charged on `billable`.
//!
//! ## ⚠️ PRIVACY — the line this vocabulary exists to hold
//!
//! These identifiers are the ONLY thing an administrator ever learns about the
//! *shape* of what an account stores. A category is a technical role
//! ("thumbnails", "index"), never a subject, a document type, a file name, a
//! folder name or a path. Adding a category such as `photos`, `invoices`,
//! `medical` or `videos` would turn a capacity-planning page into a window on
//! someone's life, and is forbidden — however useful it would look on a chart.
//! The test `no_category_names_a_kind_of_content` guards the boundary.
