//! The daily sample the storage trend is drawn from.
//!
//! ## Why a stored sample rather than a derived series
//!
//! Every other trend in the console is counted from an events table: sign-ups
//! are rows of `core.users` grouped by `created_at`. Consumption has no such
//! table — `core.users.used_bytes` is a **level**, overwritten in place by
//! whichever module stored the bytes. A level that is only ever overwritten has
//! no past to reconstruct, so the past has to be written down as it happens.
//!
//! ## One row per day, upserted
//!
//! The sampler runs from the alert-centre pass, i.e. every few minutes. It
//! refines the row for the day it is in rather than appending: a core restarted
//! five times in an afternoon still leaves exactly one point on the curve, and
//! two core processes sampling at once settle on the same row instead of
//! racing. The value kept for a day is therefore its **last** reading, which is
//! the honest one — a curve of daily maxima would report peaks the instance was
//! never at when somebody looked.
//!
//! ## Gaps are left as gaps
//!
//! A core that was switched off for a week writes no points for that week. The
//! console draws what was measured and nothing else: interpolating the missing
//! days would put growth on a chart that nobody observed, in the one place an
//! operator goes to decide whether to buy a disk.
