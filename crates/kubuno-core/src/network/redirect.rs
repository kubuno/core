//! Sending plain-HTTP traffic to HTTPS, when the instance is configured to.
//!
//! Applied as a layer over the ordinary application router, so a request that
//! must NOT be redirected is simply served as usual. Three things this has to get
//! right, and each one has broken a real deployment:
//!
//!   * **A request that already arrived over TLS is not redirected.** Behind a
//!     TLS-terminating reverse proxy the core is reached in plain HTTP on the
//!     loopback: redirecting there answers a visitor who IS on HTTPS with "go to
//!     HTTPS", which at best is a wasted round trip and at worst a loop. The
//!     proxy's `X-Forwarded-Proto` decides, and only from a trusted peer
//!     ([`super::runtime::response_is_over_tls`]).
//!
//!   * **The ACME challenge is never redirected.** Proving domain control
//!     happens over plain HTTP, and answering a renewal check with a 308 to the
//!     very certificate being renewed is how automatic renewal quietly stops
//!     working.
//!
//!   * **The destination is not taken from the client.** A redirect built from
//!     the request's `Host` header sends whatever the client asked for — a
//!     request carrying `Host: elsewhere.example` gets
//!     `Location: https://elsewhere.example/…`, turning the instance into an
//!     open redirector for phishing and scanners. When the instance knows which
//!     names it answers for (the active certificate's SANs, the configured ACME
//!     domains), an unknown `Host` goes to the canonical name instead.
