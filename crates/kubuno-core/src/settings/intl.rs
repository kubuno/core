//! The language and the time zone of the instance — and the readers that make
//! them mean something.
//!
//! ## Why the readers come first
//!
//! A setting nothing reads is worse than a missing feature: it is a control that
//! reports back. An operator who picks `Europe/Paris` and sees the value stick
//! has been told, by the interface itself, that dates are now stated in Paris
//! time. If no code path reads the key, that is simply false, and nothing on the
//! screen says so. So this module is written as *readers* — everything below
//! answers "what language / what zone applies **here**", and the two settings
//! exist to feed those answers.
//!
//! ## Resolution
//!
//! Both keys go through the scoped chain of migration `000060`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   account ?? group ?? closest organisational unit ?? instance ?? factory
//! ```
//!
//! which is what lets a multilingual organisation give one unit a different
//! language without touching a single account. When no subject is known — the
//! sign-in page, a message to an address that matches no account — the chain
//! starts at the instance, which is exactly the level meant to answer for
//! "somebody we know nothing about".
//!
//! ## What is deliberately *not* localised
//!
//! Machine-facing instants stay in UTC: API payloads, the audit trail, the
//! access log, export filenames. They are read by parsers, compared across
//! deployments and correlated with other systems' logs; restating them in a zone
//! an operator can change tomorrow would make yesterday's record unreadable.
//! Only text a human reads as a sentence is stated in the instance zone.
