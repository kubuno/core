//! Instance health — the checks a self-hosted operator has nobody else to run.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! A managed service has somebody watching it. A self-hosted instance has its
//! operator, who installed it from a command line six months ago and has had no
//! reason to look since. Nothing in the product tells them that the seeded
//! administrator password is still in place, that the data volume is at 96 %,
//! that the relay they configured has never actually delivered a message, or
//! that there is no backup at all. Every one of those is silent until it is
//! catastrophic.
//!
//! ## The shape of the answer
//!
//! One route, [`crate::handlers::admin::health`], returns a score and a list of
//! checks. Three rules govern it:
//!
//! * **The server computes, the client renders.** The console never derives the
//!   state of a setting from a value it happened to fetch for another screen.
//!   Two readers of the same fact drift, and the one that drifts is always the
//!   one saying "everything is fine".
//! * **The report is filtered by privilege.** A delegated administrator is not
//!   shown a finding they cannot act on — and, since the score is computed over
//!   what they can see, it is not a score about somebody else's problems.
//! * **A check reports a verdict, never a credential.** The internal-secret
//!   check grades the secret and returns one word; there is no code path in
//!   this module that can put the value on the wire.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! * [`model`] — wire types, the score, the counts;
//! * [`facts`] — one pass over the database, the configuration and the request;
//! * [`checks`] — the catalogue, as pure functions over the facts;
//! * [`disk`] — free space of the data volume (`statvfs`);
//! * [`secret`] — the internal-secret verdict.
//!
//! ## Caching
//!
//! The evaluation costs half a dozen small queries and one `statvfs`, and the
//! console asks for it on every admin page (the critical banner). It is cached
//! process-wide for [`CACHE_TTL`] and invalidated on every settings write, so a
//! setting the operator has just changed is never reported with its old value —
//! the single most damaging thing a health page can do to its own credibility.
//!
//! The cache holds the UNFILTERED evaluation. Filtering by privilege happens
//! per request, after the read: caching a filtered report would serve one
//! caller's perimeter to the next.
