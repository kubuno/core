//! The catalogue: every check, and the pure function that decides its verdict.
//!
//! Nothing in this file touches the database or the network — it maps
//! [`Facts`] to [`Check`]s. That is what makes the interesting rules testable
//! without a server: the thresholds, the severity escalations, and the handful
//! of places where "not configured" and "configured wrong" must not be
//! conflated.
//!
//! ## What was missing, and is not any more
//!
//! Two checks were left out of the first version rather than faked: **instance
//! language** and **instance time zone** had no setting behind them, so a check
//! reporting "ok" against them would have been an outright lie. Migration
//! `000080` declares both, and — the part that matters — code reads both: the
//! sign-in page obeys `instance.locale` before anybody is authenticated, and
//! every outgoing message is dated in `instance.timezone`. The checks below are
//! therefore about a real thing, and each of them can go red for a reason an
//! operator can act on.
//!
//! Note the shape of the two new verdicts: neither asks "is a value present?" —
//! one always is. They ask "did somebody decide?" and, for the zone, "is what
//! they typed something the formatter can actually use?". A zone name that fails
//! to parse falls back to UTC in [`crate::settings::intl`]; without this check
//! that fallback would be invisible, and every message would be dated in the
//! wrong zone with nothing on any screen saying so.
//!
//! `continuity.backup` used to be permanently `Blocked` — the honest rendering
//! of an instance that had `kubuno db:backup` and nothing that ran it. It now
//! reads the real thing (`crate::backup`): whether a policy is armed, when a
//! backup last actually succeeded, and whether the last attempt failed. The
//! verdict is deliberately about the *outcome*, not the switch: an enabled
//! policy that has produced nothing for a week is not a protected instance, and
//! a check that went green on the switch alone would be the exact lie the
//! feature was built to stop telling.
//!
//! `continuity.restore_tested` sits beside it and is **declarative**: nothing
//! verifies a restore, the wording says so in as many words, and the value comes
//! from an administrator pressing a button that only writes a date. A check that
//! implied the platform had tested a restore it never performed would be worse
//! than no check at all.
