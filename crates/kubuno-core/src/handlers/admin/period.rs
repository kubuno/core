//! The window an administration dashboard reads, and the two ways of counting
//! over it.
//!
//! # Why this is one module and not one per page
//!
//! The console has more than one dashboard — the security overview and the
//! general one — and they answer the same three questions: *which* windows may
//! be asked for, *where* a window starts and stops, and *what* it is compared
//! against. Two implementations of that would drift on the first special case
//! (the month still running, the week that starts on Monday, the axis that has
//! to land on a `date_trunc` boundary), and the operator would meet two pages
//! whose "−12 %" means two different things. It is written once, here.
//!
//! Everything below was first written for `security_dashboard`; this module is
//! that code lifted out unchanged, not a re-derivation of it.
