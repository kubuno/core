//! `/admin/security/dashboard` — the security overview, as panels of counted facts.
//!
//! # What this endpoint is allowed to say
//!
//! Every number below is a `COUNT(*)` over a table the core itself writes. There
//! is no estimation, no extrapolation, no sampling and no placeholder: a panel
//! either has a real series or is not returned at all. That constraint is what
//! makes the page worth opening — a security chart that guesses is worse than no
//! chart, because it is read as a measurement.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does NOT say
//!
//! The console this page is modelled on also charts message authentication
//! (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), transport encryption, spam filtering and external file
//! shares. Kubuno's core cannot: a module owns its own PostgreSQL schema and the
//! core never reads it. Those facts live in `mail`, in `drive`, in `photos` —
//! and until a module *declares* them, the honest rendering is their absence.
//!
//! The shape such a declaration would take is already settled by precedent:
//! `POST /internal/storage/usage` (see [`crate::handlers::storage_usage`]) is how
//! a module hands the core a figure about itself, authenticated by
//! `X-Internal-Secret` and attributed to the calling module. A security-metrics
//! channel would be its sibling — same authentication, same "the caller names
//! itself" arbitration, a closed vocabulary of metric ids instead of a closed
//! vocabulary of storage categories, and counters bucketed by day rather than
//! absolute totals. It is not built here because building a channel with no
//! producer would ship panels whose empty state reads as "nothing bad happened"
//! when it means "nobody measured". The report accompanying this change states
//! the contract in full.
//!
//! # Serving a report as well as a page
//!
//! The console's report page (`/admin/reports/<panel>`) is a printable document
//! about ONE panel over ONE period, and it reads this same endpoint — narrowed
//! by `?panel=<id>` and widened by `?full=true`. Both are explicit parameters
//! rather than a change of default: a report must name every country a sign-in
//! came from, and a dashboard must not pay for forty arcs to draw eight.
//! Everything else — the window, the comparison, the privileges — is the same
//! reading, so a figure printed on paper and the figure on the card can never
//! disagree.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Every panel is an INSTANCE-WIDE aggregate, so each one is gated on its
//! privilege **at instance scope** ([`AdminContext::has_at_instance`]). A
//! delegated administrator holding `core.alerts.read` over one organisational
//! unit is not shown an instance-wide alert count with their unit's name implied
//! on it; the panel is withheld and named in `withheld`, so the console can say
//! why the page is short rather than leave a hole.
