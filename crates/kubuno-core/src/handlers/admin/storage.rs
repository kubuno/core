//! The storage page: what the instance holds, where it sits, and who holds it.
//!
//! ## Two totals that are not the same number, and why both are shown
//!
//! * **Consumed** — `SUM(core.users.used_bytes)`. What accounts actually hold.
//!   The counter is maintained by whichever module stores the bytes; the core
//!   only sums it.
//! * **Allocated** — `SUM(core.users.quota_bytes)`. What the instance has
//!   *promised*. Routinely several times the physical volume, and that is not a
//!   bug: quotas are ceilings, and an instance that only ever allocated what it
//!   owns would be sized for a worst case that never happens.
//!
//! Neither of them is the disk. The volume figure comes from the same `statvfs`
//! read the health report uses, and it is the one that says whether uploads are
//! about to start failing. The three answer three different questions and the
//! page keeps them apart rather than averaging them into one reassuring bar.
//!
//! ## The breakdown per module, and what it does *not* claim
//!
//! `core.users.used_bytes` still has no provenance of its own — it is a single
//! number, and splitting it into plausible slices would be a chart that lies.
//! The breakdown is therefore not derived from it: it is assembled from what
//! each module **declared about itself** through `POST /internal/storage/usage`
//! (see [`crate::storage::usage`]). Three states, kept apart on purpose:
//!
//! * a module that declared — its own measurement, with the time it was taken;
//! * a module that declared **zero** — a measured zero;
//! * a module that has **never** declared — reported as unknown, not as zero.
//!
//! Whatever the declarations do not account for is returned as
//! `unattributed_bytes` and named on the page. That residue is the honest
//! measure of how much of the picture is still missing, and burying it inside
//! another slice is the one thing this endpoint must not do.
//!
//! ## No write path of its own
//!
//! Every mutation the page offers is performed by an existing audited endpoint:
//! `PATCH /admin/users/:id` for one account's quota, and
//! `PUT|DELETE /admin/settings/scoped/storage.default_quota_bytes` for the
//! default policy at instance or unit level. A second write path would be a
//! second place for the audit entry to be forgotten.
