//! `/admin/dashboard` — the instance overview, as panels of counted facts.
//!
//! # The rule, identical to its sibling
//!
//! This endpoint is the general counterpart of
//! [`super::security_dashboard`], and it obeys the same three rules on purpose:
//! one closed list of periods, one window resolver, one comparison against the
//! window of *identical length* immediately before the reading. Two dashboards
//! in one console whose "−12 %" meant two different things would be worse than
//! having only one of them, so the machinery is shared
//! ([`super::period`]) rather than re-derived here.
//!
//! Every figure is read from a table the core itself writes. Nothing is
//! estimated, extrapolated or seeded.
//!
//! # Events and snapshots are not the same kind of number
//!
//! Half of these panels count *things that happened* over the window (accounts
//! created, sessions opened, applications used); the other half describe *what
//! is true now* (how the accounts are spread between active and suspended, which
//! modules are healthy, how much of the storage is taken).
//!
//! A snapshot has no honest percentage: nothing records what the role
//! distribution looked like thirty days ago, and reconstructing it from
//! `created_at` would answer a question nobody asked. Those panels therefore
//! carry `previous_total: null` and the console prints "état actuel" instead of
//! an arrow. The single exception is storage, which *is* sampled daily
//! (`core.storage_samples`) and can therefore state a real variation.
//!
//! # What is missing, and why it is missing rather than zero
//!
//! The reference console this page is modelled on also panels **file sharing
//! exposure** — how much is shared, internally and externally. That fact lives
//! in `drive`, in `photos`, in `office`: module schemas the core never reads. It
//! is not rendered here, and the page says so in words, because a panel showing
//! `0` would be read as "nothing is shared" when it means "nobody measured".
//! The channel that would carry it is the one
//! [`super::security_dashboard`] already describes: a sibling of
//! `POST /internal/storage/usage`, authenticated by `X-Internal-Secret`,
//! attributed to the calling module, with a closed vocabulary of metric ids and
//! counters bucketed by day.
//!
//! # Serving a report as well as a page
//!
//! The console's report page (`/admin/reports/<panel>`) is a printable document
//! about ONE panel over ONE period, and it reads this same endpoint — narrowed
//! by `?panel=<id>` and widened by `?full=true`. Both are explicit parameters
//! rather than a change of default: a report must not truncate a ranking at six
//! accounts, and a dashboard must not pay a report's query cost to draw six.
//! Everything else — the window, the comparison, the privileges — is the same
//! reading, so a figure printed on paper and the figure on the card can never
//! disagree.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Every panel is an INSTANCE-WIDE aggregate, so each is gated on its privilege
//! **at instance scope**. A delegated administrator who reads one organisational
//! unit is not shown an instance-wide figure with their unit's name implied on
//! it: the panel is withheld and named in `withheld`.
