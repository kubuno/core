//! The RECORDS behind a dashboard figure — one row per underlying fact.
//!
//! # Why a counter is not a report
//!
//! A panel answers "how many"; the question that follows is always "which
//! ones". A report of failed sign-ins that states `47` and draws a curve is a
//! counter printed on paper: nobody can act on it, because the accounts
//! concerned — the only thing worth acting on — are exactly what it does not
//! say. This module is the other half: the same window, the same predicate, the
//! same privilege, listed row by row.
//!
//! # It is the same reading, narrowed — never a second one
//!
//! [`super::period::Provenance`] already states *where* a figure comes from.
//! The catalogues below are that statement made readable: the same table, the
//! same `t.` alias, the same window bounds bound as parameters. A panel cannot
//! print rows its own count did not include, because the `WHERE` clause is
//! [`Counted`]'s and nothing here may add to it.
//!
//! # What a row may carry, and what it may never
//!
//! These rows name people. Three rules, and none of them is negotiable:
//!
//!   * **No secret, ever.** Not a password, not a token, not a hash, not a
//!     fingerprint, not even truncated. Every expression below is written in
//!     source and reviewed here; there is no path by which a caller adds one.
//!     `core.devices.correlation_hash` and `core.refresh_tokens.token_hash` are
//!     the two that would be tempting, and neither appears.
//!   * **The minimum that answers the question.** An account is named by the
//!     name an operator reads, not by its whole profile row: no e-mail address,
//!     no `user_agent`, no `payload`. A report is copied, printed and filed;
//!     every extra column is a copy of personal data that outlives its purpose.
//!   * **Nothing resurrected.** Rows are read from the live table only — the
//!     same one the panel counted, whose retention purge has already run. What
//!     was purged is absent from both, so the detail can never say more than the
//!     figure above it.
//!
//! # Ceiling
//!
//! [`DETAIL_LIMIT`] rows. Beyond that the reading stops and *says so*
//! ([`DetailTable::truncated`]), because a list that stopped is not a list that
//! ended and a printed page has nobody left to ask.
