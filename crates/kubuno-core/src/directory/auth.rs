//! Which authenticator governs an account, and how a directory authenticates.
//!
//! ## The order of authentication methods
//!
//! An account can exist locally *and* in the directory, so something has to say
//! which credential decides. **An administrator decides**, per organisational
//! unit — see [`crate::auth::methods`], which owns the policy, its inheritance
//! and its anti-lockout guard. This module only *applies* it:
//!
//! > For the account in front of us, resolve the accepted methods. If `local` is
//! > accepted (or the administrative fallback applies) and the account holds a
//! > hash, the local password decides and nothing else is consulted. Otherwise,
//! > if `directory` is accepted, the directory that governs the account decides
//! > — or, when none does yet, each enabled directory gets a turn. If neither
//! > applies, the password route admits nobody.
//!
//! Three consequences, all of them intentional:
//!
//! 1. **The instance cannot lock itself out.** `auth.local_admin_fallback` is on
//!    by default, so an administrator holding a hash is routed to `Local`
//!    whatever the unit's policy says — see
//!    [`a_local_administrator_is_never_routed_to_a_directory`] below. Turning
//!    that fallback off, or narrowing a unit's methods, is refused outright when
//!    it would strand an administrator
//!    ([`crate::auth::methods::ensure_no_administrator_is_stranded`]), and the
//!    console recovery path (`kubuno auth:recover --local-access`) remains open
//!    regardless.
//!
//! 2. **A directory-provisioned account has no local fallback.** It carries no
//!    hash — there is nothing to fall back to — so revoking somebody in the
//!    directory revokes them here, which is the whole point of connecting one.
//!
//! 3. **Linking does not seize an account.** A local account matched by a
//!    synchronisation records the directory but keeps its hash. Handing it over
//!    is an explicit administrative action
//!    (`POST /admin/ldap/directories/:id/govern`) that clears the hash, never a
//!    side effect of a sync. Otherwise the first synchronisation of a directory
//!    containing the administrator's address would make the instance's own
//!    console depend on that directory being up.
//!
//! ## What the person signing in is told
//!
//! Nothing that distinguishes the cases. Whether the address is unknown, the
//! password is wrong, the directory refused the bind or the directory is down,
//! the sign-in route answers the same "Identifiants invalides" it has always
//! answered. The diagnosis lives in the log and in the administration console's
//! test button, both of which require an operator.
