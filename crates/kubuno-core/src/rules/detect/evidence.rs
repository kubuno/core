//! What the scan found, and the answer a `detector` leaf reads.
//!
//! ## Why the leaf does not scan
//!
//! [`super::super::condition::Condition::matches`] is synchronous and pure. It
//! has to be: it runs on the event worker, inside a backtest replaying hundreds
//! of thousands of rows, and inside the gate. Making a leaf able to read the
//! database or spend milliseconds on a regular expression would put an
//! unbounded cost behind a `!` in a boolean expression, evaluated as many times
//! as the tree happens to visit it.
//!
//! So the gate scans **once, up front**: every distinct `(detector, part)` pair
//! the candidate rules mention, each scanned a single time however many leaves
//! refer to it. [`Evidence`] is that table of results, and a leaf becomes a
//! lookup plus three comparisons.
//!
//! ## Nothing here survives the request
//!
//! `Evidence` holds offsets and fingerprints for the length of one call and is
//! dropped with it. What reaches the execution log is
//! [`Evidence::counters`] — how many detectors fired, how many matches, how many
//! distinct values — and not one byte of what was inspected.
//!
//! ## The empty evidence is the honest default
//!
//! Outside the gate there is no content: the bus carries an event, not a
//! document. [`Evidence::empty`] therefore answers "no" to every detector leaf,
//! which is what makes a data-protection rule inert on the asynchronous path
//! rather than accidentally firing on a fact that happens to be named `body`.
