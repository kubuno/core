//!
//! ## The three thresholds, and why the third is the one that matters
//!
//! A detector leaf states a confidence floor, a minimum number of matches, and a
//! minimum number of **distinct** matches. The first two are obvious. The third
//! is what makes a rule mean what its author read back: without it, one account
//! number quoted fifty times in a thread satisfies "more than twenty account
//! numbers = mass leak", and the rule fires on a conversation about a single
//! invoice. Occurrences measure how much of the text is about the thing;
//! distinct values measure how many people are exposed. Only the second is a
//! leak, and only the second survives somebody pasting a quote.
//!
//! Distinctness is computed over a **fingerprint of the normalised match** — case
//! folded, separators stripped — so `FR76 3000 6…` and `fr7630006…` are one
//! value, and no inspected value exists in the engine's state even in memory
//! beyond the scan.
//!
//! ## What is never persisted
//!
//! Nothing inspected, and nothing derived from it beyond a count. Read
//! [`Evidence::counters`] and satisfy yourself: a detector key an administrator
//! chose, three integers, and a rounded confidence. No offset, no fingerprint,
//! no excerpt. The one place inspected content is ever displayed is the test
//! screen, and that screen receives **offsets only** and highlights in the
//! browser the text the administrator pasted there himself.
