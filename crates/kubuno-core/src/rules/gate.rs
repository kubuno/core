//! The synchronous portal: "may this operation proceed?"
//!
//! Everything else in this directory reacts *after* the fact — an event happens,
//! a rule notices, an action follows. Data protection cannot work that way: a
//! message whose account numbers have already been sent is not saved by an alert
//! raised a second later. So a module asks **before** it commits, and waits for
//! an answer.
//!
//! ```text
//!   module ──POST /internal/rules/gate──► core
//!     │        { trigger, facts, content: { subject, body } }
//!     │
//!     │        ┌─ rules of that trigger, from the memory index
//!     │        ├─ scan once per (detector, part)
//!     │        ├─ evaluate the tree, per rule, in priority order
//!     │        └─ strongest verdict wins
//!     ▼
//!   allow │ warn │ block  + a short reference
//! ```
//!
//! ## Failing open, on purpose, by default
//!
//! A gate that refuses when it is unwell converts a hiccup in the rule engine
//! into an outage of every module that asks it a question — nobody can send a
//! message because the *policy* service is slow. That trade is almost never the
//! right one, so the default is **open**: a timeout or an internal error lets the
//! operation through and is logged loudly. Regulated deployments set
//! `rules.gate.fail_mode` to `closed` and accept the opposite trade knowingly.
//!
//! Both the policy and the deadline are settings rather than constants, because
//! the right answer differs per instance and the wrong answer is discovered in
//! production.
//!
//! The core enforces the deadline **on its own evaluation**; a module enforces
//! the same policy on its own HTTP call, which is the half the core cannot do
//! for it. [`FailMode`] is what both sides name.
//!
//! ## What the blocked user is told
//!
//! "This content carries sensitive data", and a reference. Never the rule, never
//! the detector, never the matched value, never the count. Anybody with a text
//! box and a blocking gate can otherwise map the entire policy by bisection —
//! type a candidate, observe block or allow, repeat. The reference is the whole
//! bridge back to somebody who *can* look: it is indexed on
//! `core.rule_executions`, so a compliance officer pastes it and lands on the
//! run, while the user holding it learns nothing from it.
//!
//! ## What is persisted
//!
//! An execution row: which rule, which version, which mode, which outcome, how
//! many matches, how many distinct values, how long it took. **Not the content,
//! not a value, not an offset, not an excerpt** — in the row, in the response,
//! in the audit trail, or in a log line. The content exists for the length of
//! one function call and is dropped with the request.
