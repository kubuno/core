//! Administration rule engine — "when x happens, do y".
//!
//! This is what turns the console from a dashboard into an instrument of
//! operation: an administrator states a reaction once, and the instance carries
//! it out at machine speed, on a population described rather than enumerated.
//! Everything below exists to make that safe.
//!
//! ## The rule the whole design rests on: the core knows no module
//!
//! ```text
//!   module registration ──► catalog::register_module ──┐
//!                                                      ├─► core.rule_triggers
//!   crate::rules::declare ─► catalog::register_core ───┘    core.rule_actions
//!                                                                  │
//!   bus event ─► index (memory) ─► engine::decide ─► dispatch ──────┘
//!                                        │                │
//!                                        │                ├─ core action: in process
//!                                        │                └─ module action: POST to the
//!                                        │                   endpoint the module declared
//!                                        └─► core.rule_executions (structural only)
//! ```
//!
//! The core declares its own triggers and actions **through the same function**
//! a module uses, into the same two tables, with the same validation and the
//! same forced prefixing. Grep this directory for a module identifier: the only
//! one is the `"core"` of [`catalog::CORE_NAMESPACE`]. Installing a module
//! requires zero lines here.
//!
//! ## A closed vocabulary, never an expression language
//!
//! Conditions are a serde enum ([`condition::Condition`], [`condition::Operator`])
//! with bounded depth and breadth, validated on write. A rule is auditable by
//! reading it and offers no surface for injection — see the header of
//! [`condition`] for why a small parser would have been the wrong trade.
//!
//! ## The five degrees of caution
//!
//! | mode | evaluates | logs | acts | alerts |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `inactive` | no | no | no | no |
//! | `simulate` | yes | yes | **no** | yes, **isolated** |
//! | `monitor`  | yes | yes | no | yes, real |
//! | `enforce`  | yes | yes | **yes** | yes |
//! | `backtest` | yes | yes | no | no |
//!
//! Simulation alerts are quarantined at the identity level, not merely filtered
//! at read time ([`crate::alerts::NewAlert::simulated`]).
//!
//! ## Where each piece lives
//!
//! * [`catalog`] — what modules and the core may declare, and orphan handling;
//! * [`declare`] — the core's own triggers and actions;
//! * [`condition`] — the vocabulary and the evaluator;
//! * [`model`] — modes, scope, severity, the rule itself;
//! * [`facts`] — event → the JSON a rule is evaluated against;
//! * [`validate`] — everything refusable, on write, once;
//! * [`store`] — rules, versions (same transaction), executions, thresholds;
//! * [`index`] — the memory index and its `LISTEN/NOTIFY` reload;
//! * [`engine`] — the gates, in order, plus the feedback guard;
//! * [`dispatch`] — actions, via the job runner, with idempotency;
//! * [`backtest`] — the retrospective replay and its stated limits;
//! * [`jobs`] — the three job types;
//! * [`detect`] — content detectors, their bounded scanning, and the counters
//!   that are the only thing an inspection ever leaves behind;
//! * [`gate`] — the synchronous portal a module asks *before* it commits, and
//!   its fail policy.
//!
//! ## Reacting is not enough: the synchronous gate
//!
//! Everything above reacts *after* the fact. A message whose account numbers
//! have already been sent is not saved by an alert raised a second later, so
//! [`gate`] is a second entry point into the **same** evaluator: a module asks
//! before it commits and waits for allow, warn or block. It adds no vocabulary
//! — a data-protection rule is an ordinary rule, with a [`detect`] leaf in its
//! condition tree and a verdict in its action list — and it inherits scope,
//! rollout, the five modes and the run log unchanged. Only `enforce` blocks;
//! `monitor` writes down what it would have blocked, which is how a blocking
//! rule gets armed by somebody who has already seen what it does.
//!
//! ## Not to be confused with `flow`
//!
//! The `flow` module is a **per-user** orchestrator, which its user may bypass
//! because it is theirs. This is a **per-administrator** control which its
//! subject may not. They share no code, and merging them would mean either
//! giving users a governance surface or taking their automation away.
