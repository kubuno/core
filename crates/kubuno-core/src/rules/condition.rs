//! The condition tree: a closed vocabulary, deserialised by serde, evaluated
//! against a JSON fact.
//!
//! ## Why there is no expression language here
//!
//! The obvious way to let an administrator say "when a sign-in fails more than
//! five times from outside the office" is a little expression language. It is
//! also the wrong way. A parser is a surface: it has to be sandboxed, its
//! failure modes are runtime, and reviewing a rule means reading a program. The
//! vocabulary below is an enum instead — [`Condition`] and [`Operator`]. serde
//! rejects anything outside it before the engine ever sees it, `cargo test`
//! covers every branch, and a rule can be rendered back as a sentence because
//! there is a finite set of sentences.
//!
//! ```text
//!   { "type": "all", "of": [
//!       { "type": "compare", "field": "email", "op": "ends_with", "value": "@example.org" },
//!       { "type": "not", "of":
//!           { "type": "compare", "field": "role", "op": "eq", "value": "admin" } }
//!   ]}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Bounded on purpose
//!
//! Depth and leaf count are checked on **every write** ([`validate`]), not at
//! evaluation time. A rule that would take a millisecond per event to evaluate
//! is refused when it is saved, once, by the person who can fix it — rather than
//! discovered on the hot path by the instance it is slowing down.
//!
//! ## String comparisons are case-insensitive
//!
//! Deliberate, and documented in the console: the values administrators compare
//! are addresses, domains, usernames and setting keys, where `@Example.org` and
//! `@example.org` are the same thing to everyone except a byte comparison. Every
//! other type compares exactly.
