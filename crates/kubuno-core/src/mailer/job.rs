//! `core.send_email` — outgoing mail as a background job.
//!
//! Delivery never happens on the request path. An SMTP relay that is slow,
//! greylisting, or simply down would otherwise turn "I forgot my password" into
//! a thirty-second spinner, and a transient failure into a lost message. The
//! job runner shipped with `crate::jobs` already has the retry-with-backoff and
//! crash-recovery semantics this needs, so this module only contributes the
//! handler and the enqueue helpers.
//!
//! ## The payload holds the message body
//!
//! Rendering happens at enqueue time (the request knows the recipient's locale,
//! the instance name and the origin the link must point at; the worker does
//! not). That puts the reset link — a bearer secret — in `core.jobs.payload`
//! until delivery. Two mitigations: the row is scrubbed the moment the message
//! is accepted by the relay ([`scrub_payload`]), and the tokens themselves are
//! short-lived and single-use. A job that ends up `failed` keeps its payload, on
//! purpose: retrying a delivery is the whole point, and a link that has expired
//! by then is inert anyway.
