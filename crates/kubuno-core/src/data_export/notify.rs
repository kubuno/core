//! Telling every administrator that an export has started.
//!
//! ## Why this is a security control and not a courtesy
//!
//! An export is the one administrative act that concentrates everything the
//! instance holds about everyone into a single file. The realistic attack is not
//! somebody breaking the archive format — it is somebody arriving with a valid
//! administrator session (stolen cookie, borrowed laptop, a colleague's
//! unlocked screen) and pressing the button.
//!
//! Nothing about the request itself distinguishes that from a legitimate one, so
//! the defence cannot be a check. It has to be **visibility**: the instant an
//! export is requested, every administrator sees it, named, with the account
//! that asked. Combined with `data_export.hold_hours` — during which the archive
//! exists but cannot be downloaded — that turns a silent exfiltration into a
//! two-day window in which somebody else can cancel it.
//!
//! The two halves only work together. A hold nobody is told about protects
//! nothing (the attacker simply waits); an alert with no hold arrives after the
//! file is already gone.
//!
//! ## Why the alert centre, and not an email
//!
//! Because that is where this console puts facts an administrator must see:
//! `security.privilege_granted` — an event of exactly the same class — has lived
//! there since the centre existed. An alert is deduplicated, assignable,
//! commentable and closable, it survives an unread inbox, and it cannot be
//! filtered away by a rule in somebody's mail client. An instance whose SMTP
//! relay is unconfigured (the default) would silently send nothing at all, which
//! is the one outcome this control cannot afford.
