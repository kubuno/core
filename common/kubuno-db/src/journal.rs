//! A portable change journal: the delta-sync primitive, lifted out of the
//! database and driven from Rust.
//!
//! Nine modules (calendar, tasks, notes, assistant, wiki, drive, mail,
//! contacts, chat) carry the same local-first pull layer, today expressed **in
//! the database** and tied to PostgreSQL:
//!
//! * a **`SEQUENCE`** per table plus a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger that sets
//!   `change_seq := nextval(...)`;
//! * an `AFTER DELETE` trigger that writes a **tombstone** through an upsert;
//! * child tables that bump their sync parent with a *no-op* update
//!   (`UPDATE ... SET change_seq = change_seq`) whose only purpose is to fire
//!   the trigger.
//!
//! Neither MySQL nor SQLite has a sequence, and the no-op bump does not survive
//! MySQL at all (it changes nothing, so `ROW_COUNT()` is 0 and no trigger-less
//! emulation can observe it). Rather than translate the mechanism three times
//! in triggers, this module lifts it into an **application** primitive that is
//! identical on the three engines and driven at write time from Rust.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! * **[`next_seq`]** hands out a strictly increasing `i64` per *domain* (a
//!   logical table name), safe under concurrency, with no sequence and no
//!   trigger. It is backed by a single counter row incremented atomically.
//! * **[`record_tombstone`]** writes the tombstone of a deleted row, portably.
//! * **[`touch`]** is the explicit, portable replacement for the no-op parent
//!   bump: it assigns the parent a *fresh* seq, so the row genuinely changes on
//!   every engine.
//! * **[`changes_since`]** reads the delta from a cursor — live rows and
//!   tombstones unified and ordered — the shape every module's `delta.rs` needs.
//!
//! # How a module uses it (the diff from the trigger design)
//!
//! For an owned row the module already writes, it takes the seq first and binds
//! it into that same `INSERT`/`UPDATE`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut tx = pool.begin().await?;
//! let seq = journal::next_seq(&mut tx, "calendar.change_counter", "events").await?;
//! tx.execute(
//!     "UPDATE calendar.events SET title = $1, change_seq = $2 WHERE id = $3",
//!     params![title, seq, id],
//! ).await?;
//! tx.commit().await?;
//! ```
//!
//! On delete it takes a seq and records the tombstone in the same transaction:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let seq = journal::next_seq(&mut tx, "calendar.change_counter", "events").await?;
//! tx.execute("DELETE FROM calendar.events WHERE id = $1", params![id]).await?;
//! journal::record_tombstone(&mut tx, "calendar.event_tombstones", id, owner_id, seq).await?;
//! ```
//!
//! Both the counter increment and the row write live on the same [`DbTx`], so
//! they commit or roll back together.
//!
//! # The tables a module creates
//!
//! One shared counter table per schema (rows keyed by domain), and one
//! tombstone table per synced entity. Written per engine with the [`dialect`]
//! column helpers; see the crate README for the full migration triplet.
//!
//! ```sql
//! -- PostgreSQL spelling (MySQL/SQLite: swap UUID/TIMESTAMPTZ per dialect::Backend)
//! CREATE TABLE calendar.change_counter (
//!     domain TEXT   NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
//!     n      BIGINT NOT NULL
//! );
//! CREATE TABLE calendar.event_tombstones (
//!     id         UUID        NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
//!     owner_id   UUID        NOT NULL,
//!     change_seq BIGINT      NOT NULL,
//!     deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
//! );
//! -- the live table gains a plain column, no default, no trigger:
//! ALTER TABLE calendar.events ADD COLUMN change_seq BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
//! CREATE INDEX idx_events_change_seq ON calendar.events(owner_id, change_seq);
//! ```
//!

/// * **MySQL**: it has no `RETURNING`, so the increment and the read-back are
///   two statements — but they run on the same [`DbTx`], and the
///   `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` holds an exclusive lock on the row until the
///   transaction ends, so no other session can slip between them.
/// * **SQLite**: additionally, every write transaction already holds the
///   process-wide single-writer permit (see [`crate::exec`]), so writers never
///   even overlap.
