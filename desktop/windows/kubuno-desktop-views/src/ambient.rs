//! The state a view's frame keeps in thread-locals while it runs — the clip of the container being
//! painted, the disabled ancestors, the drawings deferred to the end of the frame, the menus shown,
//! the `<Repeater>` item being handled… — and how a frame that runs INSIDE another one is kept apart
//! from it.
//!
//! A frame can start while another one is running on the same thread: a handler raised during the
//! paint (a ribbon command, a button's click) opens a modal dialog, whose nested message loop paints
//! the dialog's view before the handler returns (`ShowDialog`). The owner's frame is then stopped in
//! the middle of its paint, with its own clip, disabled scope, deferred drawings… in force. Without
//! this module the dialog would inherit them: laid out against the clip of the container the
//! command came from (a dialog opened from a ribbon showed only the ribbon's 32–146 DIP band), its
//! late drawings flushed by the owner, the owner's menu requests taken by the dialog.
//!
//! [`FrameScope::enter`] makes every frame of a [`crate::runtime::Runtime`] see only its own state:
//! a frame that starts while another is running swaps the running frame's state out of the
//! thread-locals and its own state (kept by its runtime between its frames) in, and swaps them back
//! when it ends — even on a panic. A frame that runs alone (the common case) touches nothing: what
//! the caller set for it (the designer's window band) and what a view keeps from one frame to the
//! next are read in place, exactly as before.
