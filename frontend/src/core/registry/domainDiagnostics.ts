/**
 * Extension contract: WHO reads the DNS of a domain declared on this instance.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Instance ▸ Domaines does its own small reading of a domain's mail records
 * (MX, SPF present, DMARC present) because an instance that hosts no mail
 * service still has to say something. But a real mail server knows strictly
 * more: which MX it expects to see, how many DNS lookups an SPF record costs,
 * whether the DKIM key it actually signs with is published, what the PTR of its
 * outgoing IP says, and whether its TLS certificate covers the name it
 * announces. None of that is knowable from the core.
 *
 * So the core states the QUESTION and lets whoever can answer it answer:
 * a module registers a provider under `DOMAIN_DIAGNOSTICS`, and the domain
 * sheet renders that instead of its own reading. The core names no module — if
 * nothing is registered, or the provider fails, the sheet keeps its own
 * reading. A section is never left empty.
 *
 * ── Registering (from a module's `register()`) ───────────────────────────────
 *
 *     ExtensionRegistry.register(DOMAIN_DIAGNOSTICS, '<moduleId>', {
 *       fetch: async (domain) => ({ source: 'Module Courrier', covered: true, checks: [...] }),
 *     } satisfies DomainDiagnosticsProvider)
 *
 * The first registered provider wins: two mail servers on one instance is not a
 * configuration this product supports, and silently merging two readings of the
 * same record would be worse than picking one and naming it.
