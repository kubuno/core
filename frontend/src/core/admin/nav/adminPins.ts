/**
 * The handful of admin pages this operator keeps coming back to.
 *
 * An administration console has fifteen sections and something like sixty
 * pages, and any given operator works in four of them. The reference console
 * this one takes its shape from answers that with a short, hand-curated list at
 * the very top of the menu — the pages you chose, above the tree you have to
 * walk. This is that list.
 *
 * ── What is stored, and where ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing but tab ids (`users`, `domains`) — the same ids `ADMIN_NAV` declares,
 * so a pin is re-resolved against the live tree on every render: a section that
 * is renamed follows, one that disappears simply stops being shown, and a pin
 * can never point at a page this administrator may not open (the tree is
 * pruned to their privileges before the pins are matched against it).
 *
 * Local only, like the search trail next to it: a preference, not a record.
 *
 * ── Scoped to the account, deliberately ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The key carries the signed-in user's id. A shared workstation is the norm in
 * administration, and an unscoped list would show the next operator — possibly
 * a delegate with far fewer privileges — the shortcuts of the previous one.
