// ── Admin navigation tree (Workspace-style) ──────────────────────────────────
// Collapsible sections up to 3 levels deep. A node WITH children is an
// expand-only group (not navigable — clicking toggles it). A leaf routes to
// /admin/<id>. `soon` leaves render a placeholder. `secondary` top-level
// sections are hidden behind "Show more". Existing tab ids are preserved so old
// links keep working.
//
// This module is the single declarative source of truth for the admin menu:
// adding an entry here is what makes a section reachable (see AdminPage.tsx for
// the full "add a section" checklist).

/**
 * How a section spells its address, beyond its own id.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The console addresses a place by path: `/admin/users/<id>/security`, but also
 * `/admin/resources/buildings`. The second segment is a RECORD in the first and
 * a PANE in the second, and nothing in the strings themselves says which. The
 * tempting shortcut — "it looks like a UUID, so it is a record" — is a guess
 * about the shape of an identifier, and it holds exactly until the first
 * identifier that is not a UUID (a country code, a module id, a slug), then
 * misreads an address an operator pasted, silently.
 *
 * So each section DECLARES its shape, here, next to the leaf that defines it,
 * and both the URL builder and the URL reader (`adminRoute.ts`) obey the same
 * declaration. Without it the two would eventually parse the same address by
 * two different approximations.
 *
 * ── Rules a declaration must respect ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  • `panes` is a CLOSED list of stable, untranslated ids (`security`,
 *    `buildings`) — never localised labels: an address may not change shape
 *    with the interface language.
 *  • A record id must never collide with one of the section's pane ids, or
 *    `/admin/<section>/<that-id>` would read as the pane.
 *  • A section that declares nothing keeps its parameters in the query string.
 *    That is a graceful degradation, never a misreading — which is why adding a
 *    pane and forgetting to list it here costs a prettier URL, not correctness.
 */
export interface AdminUrlShape {
  /**
   * Query parameter naming the ONE record the section opens — it becomes the
   * segment right after the section id. A section whose parameters are all

  /**
   * The `pane` values this section addresses, in the path: last segment, after

  /**
   * The panes of THIS section are not knowable at build time — they belong to
   * the record, and the record is discovered at runtime.
   *
   * One section needs this: the installed modules. Each module splits its
   * administration into pages it declares itself (`[[setting_groups]]` in its
   * manifest), so the core cannot list them here without naming modules — the
   * one thing it never does.
   *
   * Why accepting an unlisted pane is SAFE here, and only here: the flag is
   * legal solely on a section that also declares `entity`, and it is honoured
   * ONLY in third position, `/admin/<section>/<record>/<pane>`. At that depth
   * there is nothing left to disambiguate — the record has already claimed the
   * second segment, and a third segment can be nothing but one of its panes.
   * The ambiguity this whole file exists to prevent ("is this segment a record
   * or a pane?") simply cannot arise. The second segment keeps being read
   * exactly as before: the record, never a pane.
   *
   * What is still declared, and what is not: the SHAPE stays declared here (a
   * record, then its panes); only the VOCABULARY of the panes is deferred to
   * the record. The section is therefore responsible for what an unknown pane
   * means — `ModuleAdminPage` falls back to the module's first group rather
   * than painting an empty page for a bookmark that outlived a group.
