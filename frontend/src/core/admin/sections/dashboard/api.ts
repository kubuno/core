 * The dashboard's data layer — one read, no writes.
 *
 * The page performs no action of its own: every panel links to the report that
 * owns the records behind it (the account list, the session inventory, the
 * storage page, the module list), and those screens already carry their verbs
 * and their audit entries. A second write path here would be a second place to
 * forget one.
 *
 * ## Nothing on this page is estimated
 *
 * Every figure the endpoint returns is read from a table the core itself writes.
 * The one family the reference console panels and this page does not — **file
 * sharing exposure**, internal and external — lives in module schemas the core
 * never reads, and is therefore ABSENT rather than drawn as a zero. The note at
 * the foot of the page says so out loud; see `handlers/admin/dashboard.rs` for
 * the channel that would carry it.
