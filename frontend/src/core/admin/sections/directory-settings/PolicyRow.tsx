 *
 * The provenance line is not optional decoration on this page. A directory
 * policy is the kind of thing an operator sets on one branch and then finds
 * inexplicably applied everywhere; `ProvenanceLine` is what states "inherited
 * from X" / "overridden here" / "locked by X", and it carries the revert, the
 * lock and the inheritance-chain window. Reusing the component rather than
 * restating it here is what keeps this page's affordances identical to every
 * other settings screen.
