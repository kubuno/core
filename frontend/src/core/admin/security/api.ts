 * The security dashboard's data layer — one read, no writes.
 *
 * The page performs no action of its own: every panel links to the report that
 * owns the records behind it (the audit trail, the alert queue, the rule log,
 * the device inventory), and those screens already carry their verbs and their
 * audit entries. A second write path here would be a second place to forget one.
 *
 * ## Nothing on this page is estimated
 *
 * Every figure the endpoint returns is a `COUNT(*)` over a table the core itself
 * writes. Families the reference console also charts — message authentication,
 * transport encryption, spam filtering, external file shares — are absent rather
 * than approximated: they live in module schemas the core never reads, and a
 * plausible-looking curve over data nobody measured is the one thing a security
 * overview must never draw.
