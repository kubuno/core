// The scoped reading of ONE module's instance settings.
//
// A module's admin panel used to know a single value per setting — the one the
// whole instance runs on. But a setting a module declares `overridable` may
// legitimately differ from one organisational unit to the next, and the core
// has resolved settings per scope since migration `000060`
// (`GET /admin/settings/resolved`). What was missing was a way to ask that
// route about a MODULE rather than about the core, and a way to line the answer
// up with the module's own declarative schema.
//
// This file is that join, and nothing else — no React tree, no markup:
//
//   • the module's schema (`GET /modules/:id/config`) carries the PRESENTATION:
//     type, bounds, unit, placeholder, risk, `advanced`, `depends_on`, category;
//   • the resolved route carries the VALUE and its PROVENANCE: what applies at
//     the scope on screen, whether this scope holds its own row, what reverting
//     would restore, and which scopes below override it.
//
// Keys do not match on the two sides: a module declares `autosave_interval_s`,
// the core stores `notes.autosave_interval_s`. The prefix is added and stripped
// here, once, rather than at every call site.
