/**
 * Where the number came from, and what it cannot mean.
 *
 * ## The method, in one sentence
 *
 * Assembled from the three facts the server states about its own query — the
 * table, the predicate, and how rows become one number — rather than from a
 * paragraph written by hand next to each panel. Prose would have to be
 * translated into thirteen languages and, worse, would go on describing the
 * query it was written for long after somebody changed it. These three fields
 * ARE the query, so they cannot drift; the sentence around them is what gets
 * translated.
 *
 * A server that does not state them (an older one) gets no method section
 * inventing one.
 *
 * ## The caveats, which matter more here than on the card
 *
 * A caveat is a limit of the MEASUREMENT — the country database that may not be
 * installed, the failed sign-ins recorded for administrators only, the log
 * purged after thirty days. On the dashboard it sits three centimetres under the
 * chart it qualifies. On a sheet of paper handed to somebody else it is the only
 * thing standing between a number and a wrong conclusion, so it is printed as a
 * section of its own rather than as a footnote.
