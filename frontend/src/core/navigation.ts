/**
 * SPA navigation for code that runs OUTSIDE React.
 *
 * Menus are data now (`MenuItem[]` built by a plain function), background workers
 * and registries likewise — none of them can call React Router's `useNavigate`.
 * Every module had therefore copy-pasted the same `pushState` + synthetic
 * `popstate` helper; this is that helper, once, in the core.
 *
 * The shell hands it the router's real `navigate` (see `Shell.tsx`), so links go
 * through React Router proper. Before that (or outside the router — a module
 * bundle registering at boot), it falls back to History API + a synthetic
 * `popstate`, which the router listens to.
