// Data access of "Download my data".
//
// ## Three routes, and none of them names an account
//
// The subject is always the caller, taken from the token by the server. There is
// no account identifier anywhere in this file — not as a parameter, not as a
// query string — because the surface that cannot express somebody else's id
// cannot be tricked into asking for their data.
//
// ## What a 404 means here
//
// `data_export.self_service` can be switched off for an instance, an
// organisational unit, a group or one account. Where it is off, the server
// answers 404 to all three routes and the section is not rendered at all — the
// nav entry itself is gated on the `/me` feature switch (see
// `settings/navigation.tsx`). This query therefore never has to picture a
// "refused" state: it is only ever mounted where the feature exists.
//
// ## The archive is never fetched through this client
//
// A download is a full-page navigation (see `downloadUrl`). Pulling a
// multi-gigabyte ZIP through axios would buffer it in the tab's memory before
// the browser ever offered to save it — and the account large enough to need an
// export is exactly the one it would break on.
