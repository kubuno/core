/**
 * Marks a file whose earlier revisions are still stored — and still charged to
 * the owner's quota.
 *
 * Without it the accounting is invisible: somebody saves a document twenty
 * times, sees one 2 MB file in the listing, and is billed for 40. Every other
 * surface that states the figure (the details panel, the item menu, the storage
 * page) has to be opened first, which only helps a person who already suspects
 * there is something to look for. This is the one place that tells the people
 * who do not.
 *
 * Deliberately inert. A click handler here would swallow the `pointerdown` the
 * card needs to start a marquee selection, and `pointer-events: none` would
 * take away the tooltip that carries the weight — so the badge shows, and
 * reclaiming the space stays where it can be confirmed properly (context menu,
 * details panel).
 *
 * Translated from the `drive` namespace, like everything else in this explorer:
 * the strings belong to the module that owns version histories, not to the
 * shell that renders its rows. `defaultValue` covers the case of an explorer
 * mounted by a module that never loaded those translations (a file picker).
