/**
 * The design page in **project** (dev-server) mode, shared by its two entries: the core's own (`entry.tsx`, served
 * from source by the core's dev server) and a module project's (`entry.module.ts`, built into `@kubuno/host-runtime`
 * and served by the module's dev server). The registries, user controls and setup modules come from
 * `/__kubuno_design__/project.json` (`@kubuno/views-compiler`'s route); the project's controls and the view's
 * code-behind are imported through the dev server by `importModule`, which each entry defines in a module the dev
 * server transforms (so that its dynamic imports and HMR work).
