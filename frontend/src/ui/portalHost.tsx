 * themselves with `position: fixed` (relative to the viewport). When a host
 * element is provided through this context they portal INTO that element and
 * position with `position: absolute` (relative to the host) instead — so they
 * stay confined to it.
 *
 * The host element MUST be `position: relative; overflow: hidden` for the
 * confinement to hold. Used by the admin theme preview to render real dialogs
 * and popovers inside a bounded stage they cannot escape from.
