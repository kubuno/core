/**
 * What a report reads — the SAME endpoints the dashboards read, narrowed.
 *
 * ## No second dialect
 *
 * A report is not a new measurement, it is the existing one printed in full: it
 * asks `/admin/dashboard` (or `/admin/security/dashboard`) for one panel, over
 * one window, with its breakdown untruncated. Every rule that governs a panel —
 * the closed list of periods, the comparison against the window of identical
 * length before it, the privilege checked at instance scope — therefore governs
 * the report by construction. A dedicated `/admin/reports` route would have been
 * a second place for those rules to be stated, and eventually a second answer.
 *
 * ## The two parameters a report adds
 *
 *   • `panel=<id>`  — compute this panel and no other. A document about one
 *     panel has no use for the other ten, and computing them is ten times the
 *     database work for figures nobody will read.
 *   • `full=true`   — read every slice of the breakdown, not the card's top-N.
 *     A ranking cut at six is what a card wants and exactly what a report must
 *     not be. The server still keeps a ceiling and SAYS when it was reached
 *     (`breakdown_truncated`), because a list that stopped is not a list that
 *     ended.
 *   • `detail=true` — list the RECORDS behind the figure, not only its count.
 *     A report of failed sign-ins that never names an account is a counter
 *     printed on paper. The rows name people, so the server checks the panel's
 *     own privilege at instance scope (plus, where the rows are a directory,
 *     the one that opens it) and AUDITS the consultation. A dashboard card
 *     never asks for them.
