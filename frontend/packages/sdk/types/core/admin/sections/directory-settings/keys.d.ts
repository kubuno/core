/**
 * The five keys of migration `000110` and the six of `000114`, and the card
 * each one belongs to.
 *
 * Kept apart from the components so that the page's contents are a *list* an
 * operator can read at a glance, and so that adding a governed field is one
 * entry here rather than a new block of markup.
 *
 * Every key below is enforced server-side — `crate::settings::directory`,
 * called from `handlers::users::{update_me, upload_avatar, search_users,
 * lookup_users}`. That is not a decorative remark: this console has shipped
 * per-unit switches that resolved correctly and governed nothing, and a screen
 * that offers a scope bar is promising the value will be applied at that scope.
 * A key added here without a reader on the other side would restore exactly
 * that defect.

 * reason — see `DirectorySettingsSection`: it is a visibility control, not a
 * profile field, and this instance already answers it, more finely, with
 * `directory.enabled` and `directory.audience`.
 *
 * Adding one for real means three things, in this order: a column on

 * identifier from this list into `PROFILE_KEYS`. Until the first two exist, it
