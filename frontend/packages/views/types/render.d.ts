/**
 * The renderer: one renderer for compiled plans (production, dev server) and interpreted plans (the
 * designer) — the only difference is whether a binding has a precompiled getter (WEB-VIEWS §2.1).
 *
 * Granularity: every element subscribes to its view's store and recomputes the values it reads; it
 * re-renders only when one of them changed (elements are memoised, a parent's render does not re-render
 * them). The view root re-renders on every change, to run the code-behind's `use()`. The one exception is
 * `ReactHost`: the React component it hosts renders again with its view root, as it did as a child of the TSX
 * screen the view replaces (it may read state nothing notifies the view of — a registry a module fills later).
