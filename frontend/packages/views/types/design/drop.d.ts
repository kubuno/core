/**
 * Where a drop lands (a Toolbox item, or an element dragged to another place), per container kind — pure
 * (vskubuno docs/DESIGNER.md §4, §10 "Toolbox drop", transposed to the web containers):
 *
 * - routing: the element under the pointer when it takes children, else its parent (a leaf → before / after it
 *   in its parent, by the pointer's half). A `SingleWidget` container (`ScrollArea`, `Card`) delegates to its
 *   child when that child is a container, and is a valid target only while empty;
 * - `Stack` (`Flow`): an insertion line between children, perpendicular to `Direction` (reversed by
 *   `RightToLeft` / `BottomUp`, and by a right-to-left page for a row);
 * - `Panel` / `UserControl` (dock): a line between children in document order (the axis read from how the
 *   children spread, `flow_axis`); when the dragged element has `Dock`, the band it would take is reported too;
 * - `Panel Layout="Absolute"`: free X / Y (whole CSS px of the view, inline-start based: from the right edge in
 *   right-to-left), the marker a ghost of the element at the pointer;
 * - not a valid child (gated children, a filled `SingleWidget`, a leaf), or the dragged element itself / inside it:
 *   `valid: false`, drawn as "not allowed".
