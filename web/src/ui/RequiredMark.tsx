 * The asterisk that says "this one is not optional".

 * Project rule: a required field carries a mark on its label. One component so
 * the mark is the same glyph, the same colour and the same spacing on every
 * field — a rule written once is a rule that survives; a rule recopied into
 * forty forms drifts by the tenth.
 *
 * `aria-hidden`: the asterisk is decoration for the eye. Assistive technology is
 * told through `aria-required` on the field itself, which is what it actually
 * announces — a screen reader spelling out "star" helps nobody.
