// The viewBox is wider than the artwork's own 86 units: the file was drawn with
// Roboto Flex, and the shell's face (now really served, instead of falling back
// to Arial) sets "Setup" wider — at 86 the word was clipped on the right.
//
// Inlined rather than loaded as a file: the wizard runs before anything is
// installed, so there is no module, no font endpoint and no asset pipeline to
// rely on — only what the binary already serves. The colours go through the
// theme tokens (with the artwork's own values as fallbacks) so the mark stays
// readable on a dark skin instead of turning into black on black.
