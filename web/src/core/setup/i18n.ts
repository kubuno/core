// Translations for the installation wizard, in their own `setup` namespace.
//
// They live here rather than in `core.json` because they are read exactly once
// in the life of an instance and by one person — the operator installing it —
// and there is no reason for every user's bundle to carry them afterwards.
//
// All thirteen languages the product ships are written out: an installer that
// offers a language and then answers in another one is worse than one that
// offers none.
