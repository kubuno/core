/**
 * Localised wording for the delegated-administration catalogue.
 *
 * ## Why the resolution happens here and not server-side
 *
 * `core.privileges` and `core.roles` store `label` / `name` / `description` as
 * plain text, seeded in French by migrations 000044, 000053 and 000054. Those
 * columns cannot become translation keys: the catalogue is **extensible by
 * modules** — a module declares its privileges at registration and the core
 * prefixes them by force — so the core can never know the whole key space ahead
 * of time. The stored text stays the source of truth.
 *
 * What the core *does* know is its own `core.*` catalogue and its own system
 * roles, both addressed by a stable identifier the API already returns (`key`,
 * `slug`, `domain`). So the translation is looked up **from that identifier, in
 * the browser**, and falls back to the stored column whenever no entry exists —
 * which is exactly the module-declared case.
 *
 * Resolving client-side rather than by `Accept-Language` on the server also
 * means: no second translation pipeline to maintain in Rust, no language in the
 * React Query cache key, and an instant re-render on a language switch instead
 * of a refetch.
 *
 * ## An operator's own wording always wins
 *
 * A system role's `name` and `description` remain editable (only its privilege
 * set is frozen server-side). The French entries in `i18n/locales/fr/core.json`
 * are byte-identical to the migration seed, so "the stored value still equals
 * the French string" is precisely "nobody has rewritten it" — and a rewritten
 * role keeps the operator's wording, in every language. Should the two ever
 * drift apart, the fallback is the stored French label: what this screen showed
 * before any of this existed, never a raw key and never a blank.
 *
 * Which is why the French strings must be edited in step with the migrations,
 * not "improved" on their own.
