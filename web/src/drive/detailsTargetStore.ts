/**
 * What the details panel is currently describing.
 *
 * The shell's right panel mounts a component with NO props (see `RailEntry`), so
 * the explorer cannot hand it the selection directly — it publishes it here
 * instead. That indirection is the price of reusing the shell panel, and it is
 * cheaper than a second panel implementation: the shell one already brings the
 * resize handle, the per-application width memory, the overlay behaviour on
 * narrow windows and the user-customisable rail.
