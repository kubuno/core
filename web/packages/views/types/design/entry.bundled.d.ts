/**
 * The design page in **bundled** mode: the static build published as `@kubuno/host-runtime` (`npm run
 * build:design-host`), served from any origin or folder (relative URLs) — Visual Studio maps it to
 * `https://kubuno-design.invalid/` when the project has no dev server. It carries the host runtime (React,
 * `@ui`, the sdk, `@kubuno/views`, the compiler's WebAssembly, the host registry, the host CSS with the
 * production fonts, the core's translations, the light and dark Kubuno themes); the project's own controls are
 * shown as placeholders, their registry entries arriving with `projectComponents`.
