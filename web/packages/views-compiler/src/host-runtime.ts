/**
 * The host runtime of a module project's design page (vskubuno docs/WEB-VIEWS.md §18): `@kubuno/host-runtime`.
 *
 * A module's code imports the host's shared specifiers (`react`, `@ui`, `@kubuno/sdk`, `@kubuno/views`, …). In
 * production they are `external` and the host's import map gives every module the host's single instances. On the
 * Visual Studio design page served by the module's own dev server (`/__kubuno_design__/`) there is no host: the page
 * is `@kubuno/host-runtime`'s project-mode entry, and that package also ships the host's shared modules, built
 * together with the page (one React, one `@ui`, the real sdk, drive and views runtime, i18next with the core's
 * translations). In `vite serve`, for a project whose design entry is the default one, the plugin resolves each
 * shared specifier to the package's module of the same name — the dev-server twin of the production import map —
 * and keeps those exact specifiers external in Vite's dependency pre-bundling (which would make copies of them).
 *
 * The package describes itself in `dist/project/shared.json` (`HostRuntimeManifest`); nothing here hard-codes its
 * layout or the list of shared specifiers. Paths go through `node:path`, URLs are always `/`-separated.
