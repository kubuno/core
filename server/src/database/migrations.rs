/// its path could resolve `uuid_generate_v4()`: every module (search_path
/// `<module>, public`) failed its first migration on a fresh install, and a
/// second, prefixed core sharing the database failed its own migrations with
/// `function uuid_generate_v4() does not exist`. Every Kubuno connection keeps
/// `public` on its path, which is where these objects belong.
///
/// * Missing extension: created in `public`; migration 000001's own
///   `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS` then finds it and does nothing (its file,
///   hence its checksum, is unchanged).
/// * Extension already elsewhere (an install created by an earlier release):
///   moved to `public`. The four are relocatable, and column defaults, column
///   types and index operator classes reference them by OID, so existing tables
///   are unaffected; unqualified calls keep resolving through `public`.
///
/// Best effort: on failure the error is logged and the migrations run exactly
/// as before. Moving an extension needs ownership of its member objects, which
/// for a trusted extension created by a non-superuser belong to the bootstrap
/// superuser: on such an install the log names the statement a PostgreSQL
/// superuser has to run once (`ALTER EXTENSION … SET SCHEMA public`).
