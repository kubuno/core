//! Compiling a detector, and running it over a piece of content **within
//! bounds**.
//!
//! ## The threat, stated plainly
//!
//! A pattern is written by an administrator. It is executed against text written
//! by users, on a request path a module is waiting on. Those two facts together
//! are the classic regular-expression denial of service: somebody with console
//! access — or somebody who talked an operator into pasting a pattern — makes
//! every message sent on the instance cost a second of CPU.
//!
//! ## Four bounds, three of them independent
//!
//! 1. **The engine cannot backtrack.** Rust's `regex` is a finite automaton with
//!    linear-time matching guarantees. `(a+)+$` — the textbook catastrophe — is
//!    linear here. This is a structural answer rather than a mitigation, and it
//!    is why no amount of pattern review would have been a substitute: reviewing
//!    is a process, and processes are what fail at 3am. The cost is that
//!    backreferences and lookaround do not exist, which for detecting an IBAN is
//!    not a cost at all.
//!
//! 2. **The compiled size is bounded** ([`MAX_COMPILED_BYTES`],
//!    [`MAX_DFA_BYTES`]). Linear time is linear in the input *and* in the
//!    automaton: `\d{1,10000}{1,10000}` compiles to something enormous and would
//!    make every scan slow without ever backtracking. The ceiling is enforced by
//!    the compiler itself and hit at **write time**, in front of the
//!    administrator who can fix it, never on the request path.
//!
//! 3. **The inspected volume is bounded** ([`Limits::max_part_bytes`]). A part
//!    longer than the ceiling is truncated, and the report says so.
//!
//! 4. **The inspection time is bounded** ([`Limits::max_scan_ms`]). The part is
//!    walked in chunks and the wall clock is read between them, so the scan
//!    stops mid-part rather than running to the end of whatever it was given.
//!    Bounds 3 and 4 are deliberately not the same bound: the first protects
//!    against a large input, the second against a slow automaton, and an
//!    instance can meet one without the other.
//!
//! ## Why chunks overlap
//!
//! A match straddling a chunk boundary would be missed, which is a detector
//! silently failing — the worst failure mode a data-protection control has.
//! Chunks therefore overlap by [`CHUNK_OVERLAP`] and matches are de-duplicated
//! by their absolute offset. A match longer than the overlap can still be cut;
//! the overlap is sized well past the longest identifier any seeded detector
//! looks for, and [`Limits::max_match_len`] documents that ceiling rather than
//! leaving it implicit.
