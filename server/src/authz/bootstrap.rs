//! Keeping `users.role = 'admin'` and the super-administrator assignment in step.
//!
//! Since migration `000044`, what an administrator may do comes from a role
//! ASSIGNMENT; `core.users.role` is only a denormalised cache of "holds an
//! instance-scoped superuser role", kept because the module proxy forwards it
//! and the frontend reads it. The console derives every one of its entries from
//! the assignment, never from the cache.
//!
//! That left the very first administrator with nothing. The migration's backfill
//! granted the assignment to the accounts existing WHEN IT RAN, and on a fresh
//! installation there are none: the administrator is created afterwards, by the
//! installation wizard or by the headless seed, both of which wrote the cache
//! alone. The result was an account flagged administrator, admitted to the
//! console, and holding zero privileges — a console showing only the handful of
//! pages that require none, and a 403 on everything else.
//!
//! Two answers, both here: [`grant_instance_superadmin`] for the accounts being
//! created, and [`reconcile_superadmins`] at every start for those already out
//! there, whose instance cannot be repaired by a migration that has already run.
