//! The layer guard over `/admin/*`, and the extractor that hands the resolved
//! context to a handler.
//!
//! ## Why a layer *and* the per-handler extractors
//!
//! The 38 administrative routes were guarded only by convention: each handler
//! took an `AdminUser` extractor, and a signature written tomorrow that forgot
//! it would compile and serve. A layer makes the floor structural — every route
//! mounted under the sub-router is guarded whether or not anyone remembered.
//!
//! The extractors stay. Defence in depth, with a clean division: the **layer**
//! guarantees "at least an administrator", the **handler** narrows it to the
//! privilege the operation actually needs. Removing either one leaves a real
//! hole, so neither is redundant.
//!
//! ## One resolution per request
//!
//! The layer resolves the caller once and puts both the `AuthUser` and the
//! [`AdminContext`] into the request extensions. `AuthUser`, `AdminUser`,
//! `AdminAudit` and [`AdminCtx`] all read them back from there, so a request
//! that used to cost one user lookup still costs one.
