//! `core.data_export_runs` and `core.data_export_subjects` — the record of every
//! archive the instance ever produced.
//!
//! ## The rule of this file
//!
//! **The row is opened before the work starts, and it outlives the file.** The
//! first half is the discipline `core.backup_runs` follows, for the same reason:
//! a history written only on success cannot tell "nothing ran" from "something
//! ran and died".
//!
//! The second half is specific to this feature and is the more important one. An
//! archive is deleted — by the retention pass, by an operator, by a
//! cancellation. The row is not. "An export covering these 214 accounts was
//! produced on 14 August, by this person, and downloaded twice" is a fact an
//! investigation starts from, and it must survive the file it describes by
//! years. Every deletion path in this module therefore sets `file_deleted` and
//! keeps everything else.
//!
//! Nothing here ever stores a path outside `destination`, and `error` is
//! composed from the failing step rather than from an input.
