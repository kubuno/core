//! **"Download my data"** — an account exporting its own, from its own
//! settings.
//!
//! ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//!
//! # This is the administrative export with one subject
//!
//! Not a new feature: the machinery of [`crate::data_export`] already produces an
//! archive for a *selection of accounts*, and its own preamble says the
//! single-account portability request is "an `accounts` scope of one — the same
//! machinery, deliberately, so the narrow errand can never drift from the wide
//! one". This file is the door to it, opened for the person the data is about.
//!
//! Everything below the door is unchanged: the same job, the same module
//! contract ([`crate::data_export::contract`]), the same redaction rule (a column
//! list in [`crate::data_export::core_data`], not a promise), the same retention
//! pass. A credential cannot reach this archive because it cannot reach *any*
//! archive.
//!
//! # The subject is the caller, and there is no parameter for it
//!
//! No route here accepts an account identifier. The subject is taken from the
//! token, in the handler, and is the only account a request can ever name — so
//! there is no value an attacker can substitute, no identifier to guess, and no
//! authorisation check that could be forgotten because there is no decision to
//! make. `GET /me/export/:id/download` takes an id, but it is the id of a *run*,
//! and it is resolved by [`runs::get_own`], which carries the owner in the
//! `WHERE` clause rather than checking it afterwards.
//!
//! # When the feature is switched off, it does not exist
//!
//! `data_export.self_service` is resolved **for the caller** through the scope
//! chain (instance ?? organisational unit ?? group ?? account), so an
//! administrator can allow it everywhere and refuse it for one unit. Where it is
//! refused, all three routes answer **404**, and the account settings show no
//! section at all — not a disabled one.
//!
//! `403` would have been the technically accurate status and is deliberately not
//! used: it is an admission that the thing exists and is being withheld, which
//! invites the question "why me?" and leaks the shape of the instance's policy
//! to anybody who probes. `404` says the same thing the interface says.
//!
//! # The two limits, and what they are for
//!
//! * **One request at a time per account.** Enforced by a unique index
//!   (`uq_core_data_export_self_active`) as well as by a check here, because two
//!   tabs and a double-click race and only the database arbitrates.
//! * **A download ceiling.** An archive that can be fetched for ever from a URL
//!   is a second copy of the account with none of its access control. The
//!   counter is claimed atomically ([`runs::claim_download`]) so the ceiling
//!   cannot be walked past by two simultaneous requests.
//!
//! What is deliberately **not** applied is the administrative hold
//! (`data_export.hold_hours`, 48 h). That delay exists so that a stolen
//! administrator session cannot walk out with *every* account's data before
//! another administrator notices. Here the archive contains one account's own
//! data — which a stolen session can already read, page by page, in the
//! interface — so the hold would buy almost nothing and would cost the one thing
//! portability is for: getting your data when you ask for it. It remains
//! available as `data_export.self_hold_hours` for an instance that wants it.
