//! Public ACME HTTP-01 challenge endpoint.
//!
//! The ACME server (Let's Encrypt) proves domain control by fetching
//! `http://<domain>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>` and checking the body.
//! This route is deliberately unauthenticated and served over plain HTTP — that
//! is the whole point of the challenge — and returns only a response the core
//! itself put there for a pending order (see [`crate::network::acme`]).
