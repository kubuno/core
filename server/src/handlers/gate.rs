//! `POST /internal/rules/gate` — the route a module calls **before** it commits.
//!
//! Authenticated by `X-Internal-Secret` like every other internal route, so the
//! caller is a module the core spawned rather than a browser. It is deliberately
//! *not* an `/api/v1` route: a user must never be able to ask the portal
//! anything directly. Being able to submit arbitrary text and read back
//! allow/block is being able to map the policy one candidate at a time, which is
//! precisely what the response's wording exists to prevent.
//!
//! ## What a module has to do
//!
//! ```text
//!   1. declare, at registration, a trigger with content-part fields
//!      (`"type": "content"`) — or use the core's `core.content_gate`;
//!   2. before committing, POST the structural facts and the parts here;
//!   3. on `block`, refuse the operation and show `message` and `reference`;
//!      on `warn`, proceed and show `message`;
//!   4. on a network error or a timeout of its own, apply the instance's
//!      `rules.gate.fail_mode` — open by default.
//! ```
//!
//! Step 4 is the half the core cannot do for the module: a core that is
//! unreachable cannot tell anybody what to do about it.
//!
//! ## The body is never persisted
//!
//! Not by this handler, not by the engine underneath it, and not by the request
//! log: the tracing middleware records method, path and status, never a body.
//! The parts exist for the length of one call.
