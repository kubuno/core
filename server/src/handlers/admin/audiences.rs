//! Target audiences: the curated recipient lists an instance offers at share
//! time.
//!
//! ## What problem this solves
//!
//! Left to itself, a sharing dialog offers two things: one person at a time, or
//! everybody. The first is tedious enough that people reach for the second, and
//! the second is how a document meant for four people ends up readable by the
//! whole instance. An audience sits between them — "Direction", "Agence de
//! Lyon" — so that the convenient answer is also a narrow one.
//!
//! ## An audience grants nothing
//!
//! This is the single most important property and the reason audiences are not a
//! flag on `core.user_groups`. Membership of an audience confers **no access**.
//! It makes a suggestion appear in a dialog; the person sharing still decides,
//! and the permission is written by whichever module owns the resource. A group
//! carries privileges; an audience carries a proposal. Merging them would mean
//! that widening a suggestion widens rights, which is precisely the accident this
//! feature exists to prevent.
//!
//! ## Two powers, two privileges
//!
//! Composing an audience ([`keys::AUDIENCES_MANAGE`]) and deciding where it is
//! offered ([`keys::AUDIENCES_APPLY`]) are deliberately separate. The first
//! prepares a list nobody has seen yet. The second changes what every account in
//! an organisational unit is shown the next time they share something — the part
//! that can widen exposure across a whole organisation, and the part that
//! deserves to be granted on purpose.
//!
//! ## The core names no module
//!
//! A policy row carries `module_id` as free text and there is no foreign key to
//! `core.modules`. Modules that can consume audiences say so when they register;
//! the console offers those. Uninstalling a module leaves its policy in place
//! rather than silently erasing an administrator's decision — it comes back
//! intact on reinstall, and produces nothing in the meantime.
