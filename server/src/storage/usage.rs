//! Per-module storage declarations: the channel, and what the console reads
//! back from it.
//!
//! ## Why a declaration of state, and not an event
//!
//! The obvious alternative was the existing bus: a module publishes
//! `FileUploaded { size_bytes }`, the core adds it up. Three things rule it out.
//!
//! * **It is a delta.** `EventBus` is a `tokio::broadcast` channel, which drops
//!   messages for any subscriber that lags, and `/internal/events/publish` is
//!   fire-and-forget: the publisher never learns whether anybody counted. A
//!   running total built from a lossy stream of increments is wrong by an
//!   unknown amount and stays wrong forever, and the only repair is a full
//!   recount — i.e. the thing this channel does directly.
//! * **It cannot express "nothing changed".** A module that is up, healthy and
//!   holding a steady 4 GiB publishes no events at all, which is
//!   indistinguishable from a module that crashed last Tuesday. Freshness is
//!   exactly what an operator needs from a breakdown, and an event stream cannot
//!   carry it.
//! * **The envelope carries its own `module_id`.** `AppEvent::FileUploaded`
//!   names the module in its payload, chosen by the sender. Attribution that the
//!   sender writes is attribution any module can forge.
//!
//! So: a synchronous internal route that takes the module's **current total**
//! per account, and answers. Re-declaring the same total twice is a no-op
//! because the row is keyed by `(module_id, user_id)` — idempotence is a
//! property of the schema, not of the caller's care. A message lost in flight
//! costs one stale row until the next declaration, and the next declaration
//! repairs it completely rather than compounding the error.
//!
//! ## The module never names itself
//!
//! [`declare`] takes `module_id` as an argument, and its only caller derives it
//! from the authenticated `X-Internal-Secret` (see
//! [`crate::handlers::storage_usage`]). The core derives a distinct secret per
//! module, so "who is calling" is answered by cryptography rather than by a
//! field in the body. A module presenting its own secret can only ever write
//! under its own name.
//!
//! ## THE ATTRIBUTION RULE
//!
//! > **A byte is declared by the module that physically holds it, and by no
//! > other.**
//!
//! "Holds" means: the byte lives in a storage prefix that module owns, or in a
//! column of its own PostgreSQL schema. Three corollaries, and they are the
//! whole defence against double counting:
//!
//! 1. A module that writes **through** another module declares nothing for those
//!    bytes. `office`, `notes`, `flow`, `paintsharp` and friends write their
//!    documents into `drive` over `/ipc/*`; `drive` stores them, so `drive`
//!    declares them as [`Category::Content`]. Office declares only what sits in
//!    its own schema — and, optionally, a [`Category::Delegated`] line that names
//!    how many objects it is behind without weighing them again.
//! 2. A module that *indexes* files it did not write declares nothing for them
//!    (`media` scanning a folder that belongs to `drive`).
//! 3. Inside one module, one physical byte is declared once. Two rows of
//!    `drive.files` pointing at the same `storage_path` are one blob, not two.
//!
//! Why the holder and not the producer: the holder is the only party that can
//! *measure* rather than estimate (it knows about deduplication, compression and
//! the bin), the partition it produces is total (every byte has exactly one
//! holder, including bytes uploaded by hand that no module produced), and it is
//! stable — uninstalling `office` does not make its documents vanish from the
//! accounting, because they never were in its accounting.
//!
//! The rule is made *visible* rather than merely respected:
//! [`Category::Delegated`] is neither billed nor counted into any total, so a
//! module may name what it is behind and the console can show it without a
//! single byte being added twice.
//!
//! ## Converting a module to declare (the whole recipe)
//!
//! Nothing has to be added to the core: the channel is generic and the module
//! list comes from `core.modules`, which every module already writes itself into
//! at registration. A module becomes a declarant purely by calling the route.
//!
//! 1. **Decide what it holds**, by the rule above. Anything it writes through
//!    another module is not its.
//! 2. **Split that by category** — see [`crate::storage::categories`]. The split
//!    is what separates "what this person put here" (billed) from "what the
//!    module needed in order to work" (not billed).
//! 3. **Declare the complete state at startup and periodically.**
//!    `POST {core_url}/internal/storage/usage` with the module's
//!    `KUBUNO_INTERNAL_SECRET` in `X-Internal-Secret` and a body of
//!    `{"full": true, "usage": [{"user_id": …, "category": …, "used_bytes": …,
//!    "object_count": …}]}`. Retry with a backoff until it lands — the core is
//!    routinely not ready on the first attempt after a reboot.
//! 4. **Declare incrementally after each write.** Same route, `"full": false`,
//!    listing only the affected accounts with their *new absolute totals*, and
//!    listing every category for those accounts including the ones that dropped
//!    to zero — a partial declaration retires nothing, so an omitted category
//!    keeps its last value.
//! 5. **Nothing else.** No `module_id` in the body (the core takes it from the
//!    secret), no delta arithmetic, no ordering guarantees needed. Re-declaring
//!    is free; a lost call is repaired by the next one.
//!
//! A module that holds nothing still declares — `{"full": true, "usage": []}`.
//! "This module stores nothing" and "this module has never spoken" are different
//! facts and the console states them differently.
//!
//! `drive` is the worked example — see `drive/src/services/usage.rs`.
//!
//! ## `used_bytes` and the repair
//!
//! `core.users.used_bytes` keeps its own writer (the storing module, updated on
//! every write so a quota refusal is immediate). What is new is that the core may
//! now *repair* it from the declarations — see
//! [`crate::jobs::builtin`] — because two things make that safe which were not
//! true when this channel shipped: only **billable** categories are summed, so a
//! module declaring its thumbnails cannot inflate a quota; and the repair is
//! suspended whole while any declaring module is stale or has never completed a
//! full sync, so a slow module costs a stale figure rather than somebody's
//! ceiling. Every correction is audited.
//!
//! "Billable" is defined by one criterion, stated in
//! [`crate::storage::categories`]: **an account is billed for what it can free
//! itself**. Its files, its bin, a revision history it can purge — all things
//! with a handle it holds. Not the thumbnails, indexes and caches it never asked
//! for and cannot remove.
