//! Registered into the existing runner (`crate::jobs`) rather than driven by a
//! loop of its own: the runner already claims work with `SKIP LOCKED`, so two
//! core processes never synchronise the same directory twice; it already
//! retries with a backoff; and it already puts back the jobs a crash left
//! `running`. A private `tokio::spawn` would have none of that and would run the
//! same import N times on an instance behind a load balancer.
//!
//! One job carries one directory (`payload.directory_id`) and re-arms itself for
//! that directory's own interval on success, which is the same shape the two
//! built-in purges use.
