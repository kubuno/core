//! The key that protects data at rest — kept apart from the token-signing key.
//!
//! SMTP and directory passwords, OIDC client secrets, users' TOTP secrets and
//! migration credentials are all encrypted with a key derived from
//! `auth.jwt_secret`. That conflates two jobs with opposite lifetimes: a signing
//! key SHOULD be rotated (it only invalidates sessions), while a
//! data-encryption key must not be, or everything sealed with it becomes
//! unreadable. Rotating the JWT secret therefore silently destroyed every
//! stored secret and every enrolled second factor.
//!
//! So the root of the data keys now lives in its own file, next to the TLS
//! material, and rotating the JWT secret no longer touches it.
//!
//! **Upgrading an existing instance costs nothing**: the file is seeded with the
//! JWT secret currently in force, so every value already stored keeps decrypting
//! with exactly the same derivation. Nothing is re-encrypted, nothing can be
//! lost. An instance whose seed was a weak or public value should then run
//! `kubuno rotate-data-key`, which draws a fresh key and re-encrypts the stores.
//!
//! **Ownership.** Several instances can share a machine (the packaged service
//! and a development core, for instance). Each one only ever uses the key in
//! ITS state directory, and an ownership record `data.key.owner` sits next to
//! the key: the instance id, the directory the key belongs to, and a check
//! value derived from the key. A key whose record names another directory, or
//! whose check value does not match, is refused with an explicit error and
//! left untouched; a key is never taken from a directory whose record says it
//! belongs to an instance; and a key is never moved: an upgrade from an older
//! location copies it, verifies the copy and links it into place, leaving the
//! original exactly where it was.
